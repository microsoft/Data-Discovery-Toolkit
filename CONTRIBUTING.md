# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require
you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have
the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For
details, visit <https://cla.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether
you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label,
comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need
to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of
Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct
FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or
contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any
additional questions or comments.

## Permissions & Contributions

There are two ways in which you can help update the content:

* **One-off:** \
If you are not a regular contributor to the project, but you would like to
contribute some changes, the best way to do it is:

  1. Fork the repo
  2. Write in your contributions
  3. Create a PR into this repo

* **Periodic and regular contributions:** \
If you plan to update the content semi-regularly or regularly, you can be added
to the project's Contributors group. Please contact one of the project's
administrators to be added to the group.
You will still need a PR against master in order to merge your changes.

## Git guidance

Consistent with the practices suggested in this playbook, please follow the
specifics regarding git as described in this section.

### Branch naming convention

In this repo, we use the following branch naming conventions:

| Branch Type | Pattern | Example |
| - | - | - |
| Feature | feature/\<issue#>-\<short description> | feature/498-reorganize-scm-section |
| Bug Fix | fix/\<bug#>-\<short description> | bug/978-correct-grammar-myfile.md |

> **Note:**
>
> * Please, do not use personal branches. Work should refer back to a
feature/bug fix in the backlog.
> * Mind the capitalization of the branch prefix (feature, fix). Tools that
diplay branches as a hierarchy are typically case sensitive, and will display
different hierarchies for the same words with different capitalization.

### Linting

If you use VSCode as your preferred editor, please install the [markdownlint
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
and ensure that all rules are followed. This will help ensure consistency in the
look and feel of the documentation in this repo.

### Contributions and Pull requests

When creating pull requests, follow guidance similar to the one suggested in
this repo, as described in the ["Pull Request Template"](./code-reviews/pull-request-template.md)
section, under "Code Reviews". This includes linking to the work item that
prompted the pull request.

### Merging strategy

The preferred merging strategy for this repo is **linear**.
You can familiarize yourself with merging strategies described in the
["git guidance in this repo"](./source-control/git.md) document.
