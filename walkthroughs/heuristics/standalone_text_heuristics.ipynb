geraint jones hooked into the deep. marcus trescothick was the first to go after england lost the toss, caught behind off makhaya ntini (3-41). mark butcher then played on and andrew strauss was caught at mid-off for 25.  pollock is given the task of capturing the final two england wickets.  england 125-8  an authentic boundary next ball, lashed over cover for four more.  next ball jones tries to duck a bouncer and the ball barely gets above stump height, glancing the top of his head and bringing four leg byes.  jones stands up to steyn and pushes through the gap at mid-off for two.  boje tosses one up from over the wicket and jones has a dart at it, not finding the middle of the bat but smearing through a vacant mid-on for a single.  after the pace barrage, boje returns and hoggard finds a single to leave new man simon jones on strike.  the giles vigil ends in disappointing fashion as, severely hampered, he hooks at steyn and the man at deep square-leg does not have to move.  favouring the back foot as steyn continues to steam in, hoggard is glad to see one of fullish length that he can push out for a single.  after a single is scrambled, hoggard moves into the firing line and just manages to avoid a rapidly rising bouncer.  another part of unprotected giles anatomy is battered at 85mph, steyns skidding short one catching him in the armpit.  hoggard jabs down at the final moment to keep out a yorker from kallis that was destined for the timbers.  an appeal begun only by the keeper for caught behind against giles down the legside increases a little in volume, but darrel hair is not impressed.  hoggard does not know too much about a full and fast delivery, which he inside edges to fine-leg for a single.  : giles hooks uncomfortably again with one hand off the bat, but the single gives him temporary reprieve from the hostile steyn.  the return of kallis is warmly greeted by giles, who clips a loosener neatly off his pads for four.  matthew hoggard is the latest casualty, another short one from the aggressive steyn thwacking into his arm guard.  the next ball is also short and giles plays an unconvincing hook, with one hand coming off the bat, but some contact is made and giles is grateful to stutter through for a single.  giles is thumped again by another short one.  giles ducks into a brutal low bouncer from steyn, the ball crashes into his elbow and loops over the slip for four leg byes.  steyn returns for pollock as south africa look to wrap up the innings.  the hook proves to be the undoing of jones, who picks out rudolph in the deep off ntini.  jones edges low through a gap where fourth slip would have been, bringing four urgently needed runs for england.  another hook goes high into the space in front of square, but determined fielding from rudolph restricts jones to two.  persisting with the hook shot, jones is fully in control but can only get a single to deep square-leg off pollock.  jones hooks uppishly at ntini and is within 10 yards of carrying to the fielder on the fine-leg boundary.  aiming an expansive drive into the off-side he gets an inside edge and escapes with a single.  jones pummels a cut shot off pollock into the boards for his second four.  vaughan is rapped on the pads bang in front by a skidding delivery from ntini and umpire taufel confirms his worst fears.  pollock unsettles vaughan with a bouncer that follows him and catches the glove.  a controlled thick edge from jones finds the gap between third slip and gully and races for four.  ntini returns, his first delivery down the legside and easily turned for a single by vaughan.  geraint jones picks up a short one from pollock and the ball soars over the ropes for the maximum to open the wicketkeepers account in emphatic fashion.  vaughan rocks back to guide a forcing shot for a much needed boundary off boje.  flintoff is beaten for pace by pollock and his hook shot loops up tamely off the splice to square leg to leave his team in turmoil.  vaughan appears to lose sight of a short one from pollock, and having planned to leave it fends it awkwardly with the glove, before scrambling through for a risky single.  vaughan is able to pinch a single as his gentle push on the off side defeats the fielder on the bounce.  thorpe is trapped plumb in front by the metronomic pollock.  boje resumes after the interval, vaughan crashes one into jacques rudolph at silly point but slices the next ball through gully for four.  england 58-3  vaughan and thorpe get through safely to lunch but know that much more will be required this afternoon.  vaughan, badly needing to play a major innings, strikes a fluent boundary off boje.  kallis switches ends and produces a maiden as england look towards the safety of the luncheon interval.  new man graham thorpe clips a single from the final ball of the over.  the single proves effective as key man strauss takes the strike and lofts a catch to extra cover, where ntini swoops low to cap a fine morning for the home side.  boje finds some early spin with his third delivery and catches the edge of vaughans bat as the england captain pushes forward, but de villiers spills the chance and the ball falls to safety.  kallis is replaced after two overs and the spin of nicky boje is tried 13 minutes before lunch.  there is nothing to stop a strauss cut shot which brings up the england 50 in the 24th over.  strauss is denied a certain boundary when his pull shot strikes square-leg umpire simon taufel.  kallis escapes with a maiden as a sumptuous looking drive from vaughan goes straight to the ubiquitous amla in the covers.  strauss strokes the next ball gloriously down the ground for his fourth boundary.  vaughan pirouettes to pull steyn stylishly but only for a single as the distinctive figure of amla fields on the square-leg fence.  strauss eases the pressure a little by bisecting the field with a trademark drive to the boundary, as kallis struggles to find his rhythm early on.  jacques kallis is introduced, having been unable to bowl in the first test or in india, his first delivery is easily clipped into the legside for vaughans first run.  more conviction in this pull shot from strauss, and steyn is dispatched to the boundary.  just a single from the over, a hook from strauss, who moves to nine.  michael vaughan is given a bouncer first up and survives an optimistic shout for lbw.  an inside edge onto the stumps off steyn ends butchers innings in disappointing fashion again.  a nicely timed cover drive brings butcher three runs, with the intrepid amla cutting the ball off a yard inside the ropes.  ntini replaces pollock, who is left to fume in the outfield, his face a light shade of crimson.  steyn completes his second maiden, restricting butcher with an accurate off-stump line.  pollock hurls the ball back at strauss and throws in a few choice words for good measure.  the extra bounce of durban provides some uncertainty for strauss, an attempted cut and hook bouncing too high for him.  dale steyn is brought into the attack and herschelle gibbs provides him with a maiden with an agile diving stop in the gully.  butcher has to scamper through as he attempts a quick single to amla, who is quicker than perhaps the left-hander gives him credit for, luckily for him the throw is a fraction high.  an elegant drive on the tips of his toes from strauss through mid-off gives him his first boundary.  mark butcher nudges ntini into the legside to open his account.  pollock maintains the south africa stranglehold with another over offering no easy runs.  a stunning one-handed catch by de villiers off an inside edge ends trescothicks bright innings.  strauss gets down to ntinis end and is happy to receive a ball on the pads which he clips neatly away through square-leg for three.  trescothick slashes a wide one from ntini not quite out of the middle, but there is enough on it to clear nicky boje in the gully and race for four.  strauss looks for a single after driving to the right of hashim amla, but the fielder gets across well and ensures another maiden.  the wild ntini produces a maiden, the final ball of the over keeping low and bouncing in front of wicketkeeper ab de villiers.  strauss, keen to get off the mark, attempts a drive at pollock outside off-stump but misses and it is another maiden.  ntini asks the question of darrell hair but trescothick is a long way forward, he clips the next ball off his pads for two more.  another probing maiden from pollock, with strauss content to remain on nought and leave them outside his off-stump.  trescothick thumps the final ball of ntinis over through the covers into the boundary boards.  pollock maintains a tidy line outside off-stump to strauss, who is yet to get off the mark.  trescothick picks the gap at mid-off, punching ntini for the days first boundary.  ntini, bowling over the wicket, angles a short ball across trescothick, who does not take the bait.  pollock overpitches as trescothick gets the scoring under way for england with an off-drive for three runs.  graeme smith (captain), herschelle gibbs,

way into the fourth set.  roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third-set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set.  nadal earns the first mini-break in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour. a couple of stunning points follow, one where nadal chases down a roddick shot and turns into a passing winner. then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 4-4. roddick has two serves for the set but double-faults to take the score to 5-5. nadal saves a roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley - and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild.  nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go 15-40 and two set points up. roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game. the set will go to another tiebreak.  nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set.  roddick again holds on, despite some brilliant shot-making from his opponent.  nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick.  roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point.  nadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes 0-30 down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence. but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set.  roddicks serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set. three times, nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in. and roddicks grit pays off as he manages to hold.  roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point, which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold.  there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd. the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is. one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down. roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner.  the game passes the two-hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set.  now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it. it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked half-volley winner.  roddick is looking a little leaden-footed but does carve out a break point for himself. but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger.  roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles. he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points. the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level.  nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold.  two good serves put roddick 30-0 up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself 30-40 down. he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold.  roddicks level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak. the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point.  roddick double-faults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered, powering a passing winner past roddick.  nadal wins another tight game. neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set.  nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold.  nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first-set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second.  roddick double-faults to concede the first mini-break and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak. he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points. but roddick saves them and then earns one himself. nadal comes up with a down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on roddicks next set point.  nadals nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak. both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide.  a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points. the point of the match so far involves roddicks slam-dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally. on the very next point, nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud. but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game.  nadal outplays roddick to reach 40-0 but the american fights back to 40-30 before nadals powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game.  the crowd are getting very involved, cheering between roddicks first and second serves. but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set.  nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve. the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord.  roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure. a well-placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds.  a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game - the first time he has held serve so far in the match. if roddick didnt know before, he knows now that he is in a real contest.  another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof. he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows. four of the first five games have seen a break of serve.  despite the disappointment of losing his serve, roddick is not phased and storms into a 40-15 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line-call. nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net.  roddicks advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately. a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve, nadal pumps his fist in celebration.  the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadals serve from the start. nadals drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break.  after moyas win in the opening rubber, a raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadals impressive start which sees him race into a 30-0 lead. however roddick fights back to hold his serve.",

                  "2": "dallaglio his own man to the end  controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career.  even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue, just four days before the start of the season. but then dallaglio has always been his own man. ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions. to supporters of england, dallaglio could do no wrong. an integral part of a sustained period of success for england, dallaglios crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003.  rival fans, meanwhile, have tended to take an alternative view, seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby. never afraid to speak his mind, be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch, or his coach or the media off it, dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993. it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv, but once there he proved to the manor born. displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years, dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard.  within two years of his debut, dallaglio was offered the england captains band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa. although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team-mate martin johnson, he played a massive role in the 2-1 series victory. but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.  first came the last-minute defeat to wales in which dallaglios decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam. worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy. with sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages, a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper. but he bounced back, getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold, albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson. as a member of a new-look england side on the long road to world cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned - dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.  yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglios involvement on the lions tour to australia.  rumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace, but ever the pragmatist, he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre.  the only player to play every minute of englands world cup triumph in australia, dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure englands historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters. following johnsons retirement, dallaglios career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain. while england did not hit the heights in dallaglios second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post-world cup tests, dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations. dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of englands most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.  the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. the likes of matt dawson, jonny wilkinson, phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglios role as captain. but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old. although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglios massive influence on english rugby.",

                  "2": "federer joins all-time greats  the last year has seen one player dominate mens tennis, and one country dominate the womens game.  roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in 1988 to win three grand slams in one season. and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open, two more followed at wimbledon and the us open. meanwhile, briton tim henman enjoyed his best year, while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles, and set about conquering new ground. the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open.  he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final. andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon, and federers performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking. federer again got the better of hewitt in the season-ending masters cup. his victory in houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final, an open era record. the only major let-down was a third-round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open, and roland garros will be his main target in 2005.  there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games, which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold. another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup, which was won by spain in a 3-2 home success over the usa in seville. roddick struggled on the clay, losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all-important fourth rubber.  henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open - a stunning effort - and also at the us open. a quarter-final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the britons defeat, but he remains optimistic of going further next year.  british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year, returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march. with his ranking down at 168, many feared the 31-year-olds career was over, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. the russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004, with myskina, maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams, before taking the season-ending fed cup. but while the young russians were on the way up, it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters. only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo, whose grand slam drought goes on. the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin-hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open.  a virus ruined the rest of henin-hardennes year, although she was fit enough to win olympic gold, but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt, and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence, myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all-russian final at the french open. wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw19, showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title.  davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but, hampered by injury, lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis. kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing, with the latters wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. with the russians still improving, the likes of henin-hardenne, clijsters, davenport, mauresmo, venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the mens side.",

                  "2": "highbury will be our cup final  arsenal is a very special place for me because it is one of the few away games i remember going to when i was a boy.  i cant remember what the year was but i was so young i was in short trousers. my father worked for english steel corporation, he was a crane driver and worked 12-hour shifts. every year they had a trip to london and in this particular year they were going to london to watch arsenal play.  i remember him smuggling me on to the bus then into the imperial hotel, which i remember vividly, and then smuggling me over the turnstiles at highbury. i remember looking across at the massive clock which has gone now and it is a memory i will never forget. it was a marvellous game, the arsenal fans were absolutely brilliant and all the sheffield united fans mixed with them.  we lost 1-0 but our centre-half joe shaw was, for me, the best player in the world that day. on saturday my son, who at three-and-a-half-years is a similar age to what i was, is going to be on the pitch before the game, while my daughter is the mascot. i think it will have the same effect on him - i dont think you forget things like that. i think the next time i went to highbury was when i took a team there. when i was at notts county we went there in the top flight and lost 2-0, but i took huddersfield down there for the second leg of the league cup and got a draw. i think they expected to get a cricket score because they beat us 5-0 in the first leg. ian wright was in the team and george graham made one or two comments that made us pretty determined and had they not equalised late on we would have won that leg. they are a club i admire a lot. after we played arsenal in the semi-final in 2003 the number of letters and messages i got from arsenal fans regarding the behaviour of our fans and our team was quite outstanding and it just shows they are a great set of supporters. everybody will be making an issue of that game at old trafford. i felt personally hard done by. you dont mind getting beat but in this particular case i think everybody saw their goal - scored by freddie ljungberg - was a travesty and should not have been allowed. i got fined for comments i made about referee graham poll, though i would not take any of those back. but thats how it has gone for us. the higher you go means you have to have premier league referees and we have never really done very well with them. i would have liked a football league official but neale barry, who is an experienced referee, has been awarded the game and you have to get on with it. that said, i think we will need more than help from the referee on saturday after watching them demolish crystal palace on monday.  i turned it off after they scored three goals in about eight minutes and watched bambi with the kids. since i have watched the premiership there have been a number of players who i think have been absolutely out of this world and would have paid anything to watch. one was eric cantona and another was gianfranco zola, who i thought was absolutely fantastic. arsenal have two of those type of players. i still cannot believe some of dennis bergkamps touches. his movement, footballing brain and awareness - and at nearly 36 - is incredible. i dont think any adjective is good enough to describe thierry henry. for me he is the rolls royce of arsenal and the premiership itself. no doubt they will be thinking of resting a few players for their champions league game on tuesday, but i am doing the same for our championship game with plymouth! that is a far more important game for us. arsenal is like our cup final, i feel like we have already got to the final - we have earned the money we set out to earn for the club and now we can enjoy our day out. plymouth is the next big game for me and we have to be ready for that. whatever team arsenal play it is going to be a hell of a difficult task to get anything - we are just thinking about being respectable. after looking at palace the other night i think you will probably get odds of 100-1 for us to win - and thats in a two-horse race.  people ask me if we have done anything different in our preparations this week? we have...nothing! the players have been too exhausted after playing for almost an hour with 10 men on sunday that they have not been able to do anything. they have done stretches and warm downs but very little football because of tiredness. on thursday we will work on something but when it comes to dealing with bergkamp and henry i will probably say to my defenders just close your eyes and get your fingers crossed. when they are on their game there is not much you can do about them.",

                  "2": "tapping-up row is so much hot air  the big talking point of the week is the issue of making illegal approaches or tapping up a player.  as usual, the issue is probably blown out of proportion, but i dont think anyone in football will deny there is a problem with the rules as they apply to recruiting players. i read somewhere at the weekend that they did a straw poll and questioned every player at a particular club as to how he got there. just about every one said the first approach was through their agent, or a third party or somebody involved with the club.  on that basis, under the rules as they stand, they all got there illegally. thats the name of the game these days, im afraid. not that i have ever tapped a player up - i wouldnt dream of it! i know there is a school of thought that says the rules that apply in football just wouldnt be tolerated in the outside business world. in business, if you want to change jobs, you can simply go and have a chat with another prospective employer. but in football youre not allowed to do that. football does have strange anomalies. for example, the game has a disciplinary procedure where there is no evidence but you can still find yourself in trouble. its the sort of thing that wouldnt happen in a court of law.  compared to the outside world, football does have some very restrictive practices, and a lot of them have to be looked at, but if you want to be part of it, you have to adhere to the rules. you try and do things the right way, but its like buying a house. if you do things properly and play by the rules youll find yourself gazumped. but i dont think the tapping situation is as bad as people say, a lot of it is hot air. by its very nature, the only people who would be approached are the top players who are in demand anyway. i dont think you would find too many approaches being made to bad players. the championship is building up to an exciting climax, and in beating us 2-0 last week, ipswich gave signs of what a good team they are. i think a place in the top two is beyond our reach, but any one of 11 teams could make the play-offs and there are still 15 games to go.  of course the play-offs are exciting for fans, but theyre not great for the heart-rates of managers. i think ive been involved in five play-off finals now and they should really come with a government health warning. ideally, you wouldnt want to be involved in the play-offs, and the way to do that is to finish in the top two, but i think that is beyond us now. weve got a decent run-in, were still trying to strengthen the squad and by the time the next league game comes round i would hope weve got somebody in.  but that brings me on to another matter, and the fact that the next game is more than a week away because of international matches. youre always concerned about your players getting injured and some clubs withdraw their players more than others. i always try and let our players go out for international games - it keeps them happy. but the other thorny issue with internationals is that of wages. i think that while players are on international duty, their wages should be paid by their countries. sometimes, they can be away for a week or more, but the clubs still have to find their wages, even though the player is denied to them for that period of time. of course, if a player is injured while on international duty, its the clubs who have to pay his wages while hes out of action and recovering. i think the associations of the country involved should bear some share of the responsibility.",

                  "2": "italy 8-38 wales  wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome.  tries from jonathan thomas, tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain, shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this years tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and michael owens long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in.  stephen jones, who retained the kicking duties despite gavin hensons heroics against england, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.  henson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum, the home sides forward power brought them back into it. but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.  wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try. jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy. henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.  henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, jones adding the conversion. italy, who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. de marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain. before italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over.  with jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner. the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe. but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco, w pozzebon, a masi, l nitoglia; l orquera, a troncon; a lo cicero, f ongaro, m castrogiovanni, s dellape, m bortolami (capt), a persico, mauro bergamasco, s parisse.  g intoppa, s perugini, ca del fava, d dal maso, p griffen, m barbini, kp robertson.  g thomas (capt); h luscombe, t shanklin, g henson, s williams; s jones, d peel; g jenkins, m davies, a jones; b cockbain, r sidoli; j thomas, m williams, m owen.  r mcbryde, j yapp, i gough, r sowden-taylor, g cooper, c sweeney, k morgan.  andrew cole (australia).",
