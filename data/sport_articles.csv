6,football242.txt,"pennant guilty of wasting talent  had jermaine pennant fulfilled the enormous potential that convinced arsenal to pay notts county £2m for the 16-year-old in january 1999, his fall from grace might have registered more than a blip on footballs richter scale.  but the nottingham-born winger has repeatedly failed to grasp the opportunities presented to him by the gunners, so much so that it is inevitable the club will release him when his contract expires in the summer. pennant effectively blew his chances of ever making it at highbury by upsetting the clubs normally unflappable manager arsene wenger, who finally lost patience with the players poor timekeeping. now, after being caught drink-driving for the second time in 12 months, pennant no longer has to worry about whether he makes it to training on schedule.  aged 22, there is no doubt pennant still has time to resurrect his career when he is freed this summer. compare his fate with that of west bromwich albion striker lee hughes, who will be 34 by the time he has served his six-year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving. pennant may even find himself back at birmingham city, the club who handed him a lifeline when it became clear his arsenal career was well and truly over. blues manager steve bruce apparently saw enough in pennant in the month he was at st andrews to issue an empassioned plea for leniency ahead of sentencing, claiming he had finally turned the corner. ""weve got him in a flat up here, weve got him away from the distractions of london, weve had someone with him for the best part of every day and .. done everything we can to try and put him on the straight and narrow,"" bruce said ahead of tuesdays court hearing.  ""hes done wrong and weve all done stupid things when we were younger and he admits that now. ""you cant describe how stupid he has been but as long as he learns from it, i dont think there is going to be any benefit from sending him to prison."" the judge apparently disagreed. birmingham chairman david gold said last month he would still be keen to sign pennant even if the 22-year-old got a custodial sentence. but wherever pennant ends up, talk will not be of his potential but whether he can steer clear of trouble off the pitch. pennant has insisted in the past that he does not have an attitude problem. but this is a player who, as well as failing to turn up to training on time, has been:  - caught driving under the influence of alcohol twice;   - sent home by england after breaking a team curfew before a euro under-21 qualifier against turkey in april 2003;   - and been sent off in an u-21 friendly against croatia in august of the same year for punching an opponent, although he claimed he was racially abused. pennants supporters may claim that too much fame and money at an early age are in some way to blame for his lapses in judgment. during his sentencing, his lawyer barry warburton told the court pennant had never been in trouble during a difficult childhood in nottingham, despite growing up on ""one of the worst estates"" in the city. he had only ""intermittent"" schooling and when he arrived at arsenal ""had very little reading and writing skills"". ""they in fact educated him,"" said mr warburton, who had claimed imprisonment ""could completely destroy his career"". but his childhood aside, pennant knows he has been treading a fine line for some time. he has publicly stated on numerous occasions that he is grateful to wenger and arsenal for their faith in him. yet he continues to spurn the chances that are given him. it all looked so good for pennant when he scored a 10-minute hat-trick against southampton on his full league debut for arsenal in may 2003. yet his wayward behaviour coupled with his inability to displace robert pires from the gunners first team mean he is a talent quickly disappearing over the footballing horizon. whether he vanishes completely is down to him. as professional footballers association chief executive gordon taylor puts it, pennant is now at a ""crossroads in his career"". ""i hope he has got the strength to come out of this and be better for it,"" said taylor."
7,cricket030.txt,"denness leads luckhurst tributes  former kent and england skipper mike denness has paid tribute to former team-mate brian luckhurst following his death from cancer at the age of 66.  luckhurst, who became kent president last year, played for the club between 1958 and 1976. his international career consisted of 21 tests and he scored two hundreds to help ray illingworths england side win the ashes in australia in 1970-71. ""he was a great buddy and a loyal servant,"" denness told bbc sport. ""in cricketing terms, he probably didnt have a lot of natural gifts, but with the gifts he had, he worked so hard at it that he deserved to reach the top which he did by opening the batting for england.""  kent chairman carl openshaw said luckhurst had been ""loved, admired and respected"" by everyone at the club. ""brian luckhurst has been at the heart of kent cricket for the past 50 years, firstly as an outstanding player, then in a variety of administrative capacities and finally as an immensely popular president. ""throughout that time, he was always caring, loyal and totally committed to kent,"" he continued. born in sittingbourne, luckhurst joined the staff at canterbury at the age of 15 and during his first-class career made more than 22,000 first-class runs at an average of 38, including 48 centuries.  he was a member of the kent team which dominated county cricket in the 1970s when they won nine trophies outright and also shared the county championship in 1977. luckhurst was 31 when his chance to play for england came along in a home series against a rest of the world xi in 1970. he was named in the ashes squad the following winter and marked his official test debut, as geoff boycotts opening partner, by scoring 74 and 20 not out in a draw against australia in brisbane. the following game in perth saw him bat for almost six hours to score 131 and he also made 109 in the fifth test at melbourne as england took the series 2-0. ""it was a terrific performance and he, along with geoff boycott and john edrich, were the three who scored all the runs. ""in one match, i think it was at melbourne, he wouldnt take his glove off at the break because he thought he had damaged a knuckle. in fact, he had fractured the knuckle but he got a hundred,"" said denness.  luckhurst made an unbeaten 108 in his first test on english soil against pakistan and added another century against india later in the 1971 season. although he appeared in three one-day internationals, his style was better suited to test cricket, but he lost his place after the 1974-75 tour to australia when the pace and ferocity of dennis lillee and jeff thomson proved too much for england, who lost 4-1. ""it was a torrid time for all of us,"" added denness, who was england captain on that tour. ""he was a great tourist, a great man to have [around] and a great performer. if you look at his test record, its a very good record.""  after retiring from the kent first team, luckhurst captained the second xi before moving into coaching and later had a spell as a sports centre manager. in 1985, he made an unexpected return to action when kent suddenly found themselves with only 10 players against the touring australians. in recent years he worked in the clubs commercial department before taking on the presidency. but he was diagnosed with cancer in may 2004. ""over the last 50 years i have faced many challenges - this is going to be the biggest,"" he said at the time. luckhursts death was the third among the international cricket fraternity in the space of 24 hours following those of former west indies batsman allan rae and ex-new zealand wicket-keeper ian colquhoun."
8,cricket024.txt,"indias top six secure - ganguly  captain sourav ganguly has revealed india will not be tempted into tinkering with their batting order for the first test against pakistan.

""to be honest, dravid has batted better than laxman at three,"" ganguly added. ""if you ask any batsman, he would like to bat higher up, as it gives a greater opportunity to score. ""while batting lower down the order, you have to play more with the tail."" ganguly gave his backing to gautam gambhir, banishing speculation yuvraj singh could be asked to open the batting again after a failed experiment against australia last year.  ""i feel there is no born opener - the team has to find one,"" he stated. ""look at justin langer, he was not an opener, but how well the aussies have groomed him. virender sehwag is a settled opener now both in tests and one-dayers, and gambhir is doing well. ""in a years time, we should have a settled opening pair."" sachin tendulkar, who will bat at number four with ganguly at five, also received the support of his skipper despite concerns over fitness and form. ""when sachin says he is 100 percent fit, he is, and nobody has a right to talk about the form of a man who has 70 international hundreds."" with wicket-keeper dinesh karthik to come in at number seven, india are left with just four spots for bowlers - suggesting yuvraj could miss out.  mohali, which will host the first test starting on 8 march, is known as a seam-friendly pitch and india have included four pacemen in their 14-man squad. in addition to spinners anil kumble and harbhajan singh, india will be forced to choose from the pace quartet of irfan pathan, zaheer khan, ashish nehra and lakshmipathy balaji. ""in kumble and harbhajan, we have two world class spinners and at the moment there is no place for a third one,"" ganguly said. ""our seam attack had done particularly well during the pakistan tour last year, and we will select the final eleven after having a look at the wickets in mohali, which has had a record of a seaming track."" ganguly refused to get carried away with the fact pakistans pace attack has been depleted with the absence of shoaib akhtar through injury.  ""i feel pakistan has a young and fit team, which is hungry for success. in my view they have done the right thing by bringing a fit team, rather than bringing injured players,"" he said. ""it is better to have a fully fit team than having an injured shoaib akhtar or even don bradman for that matter. ""i do not agree with those who say pakistans team is weak and has given india a walkover. ""it will be a tough series and the next 50 days will be a treat for fans of both sides."""

11,rugby029.txt,"wales win in rome  wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome.  tries from jonathan thomas, tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain, shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this years tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and michael owens long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in.  stephen jones, who retained the kicking duties despite gavin hensons heroics against england, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.  henson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum, the home sides forward power brought them back into it. but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.  wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try. jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy. henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.  henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, jones adding the conversion. italy, who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. de marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain. before italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over.  with jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner. the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe. but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco, w pozzebon, a masi, l nitoglia; l orquera, a troncon; a lo cicero, f ongaro, m castrogiovanni, s dellape, m bortolami (capt), a persico, mauro bergamasco, s parisse.  g intoppa, s perugini, ca del fava, d dal maso, p griffen, m barbini, kp robertson.  g thomas (capt); h luscombe, t shanklin, g henson, s williams; s jones, d peel; g jenkins, m davies, a jones; b cockbain, r sidoli; j thomas, m williams, m owen.  r mcbryde, j yapp, i gough, r sowden-taylor, g cooper, c sweeney, k morgan.  andrew cole (australia)."

""i believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in sheffield, i can run my race from the front, back or middle,"" said mcilroy. new coach tony lester has helped get mcilroys career back on track. the 28-year-old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. mcilroy now lives in windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former army sergeant lester. lester is better known for his work with 400m runners roger black and mark richardson in the past but under his guidance mcilroy has secured five wins this indoor season.  mcilroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for ireland at the outdoor european championships in 1998. ""that was my last decent year,"" said mcilroy, who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lesters shrewd guidance.

""i never write myself off and lets face it, i havent or looked like being beaten this season."" and mcilroy, whose time of one minute 46.68seconds in erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the uk all-time list, is also already looking beyond madrid. he said: ""ive been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important.

100,football251.txt,"odriscoll concern at fifa ruling  bournemouth boss sean odriscoll is concerned at the impact that the transfer window system could make, if it is applied to football league clubs next season.  the league was recently informed by fifa that its 72 clubs would no longer receive any further dispensation to trade players outside the world governing bodys transfer windows after the end of the current campaign. the matter will now be discussed at the next meeting of all clubs on 10 march - when a league working party set up to consider the implications of fifas decision is set to report back. the clubs will then decide on the next step to take, league communications executive ian christon confirmed. if it is applied to the football league, odriscoll feels the fifa-imposed system could harm the chances for young players at premiership clubs to gain experience in the lower leagues.  when injuries have struck, odriscoll has used the short-term loan market to bolster his small squad - a move which is not possible under the ""window"" ruling which currently just applies to the premiership, and prevents the transfer of players during the season - except during the month of january.

""weve got to come in line with the rest of europe, but itll cause us major problems as we live on a knife-edge."" however, odriscoll accepts that with the loan market blocked, clubs such as bournemouth will have to look to their own youth ranks when injuries begin to bite. ""the better youth systems will play an important part, and youll have even younger boys being part of the first-team squad,"" he explained. ""weve got two 17-year-olds in our squad whove come through the youth system [james coutts and james rowe] and im sure well have four or five next year - just so they can train with the first team.

136,football124.txt,"mourinho plots impressive course  chelseas win at fulham - confirming their position at the premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season.  they have got strength in depth, great players, an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match. all they need to add now is the big prizes which, as we all know, is the most difficult part of all. one thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed. they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge, won at newcastle in the carling cup, and then won 4-1 at fulham, which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. as i said, winning the major honours is the hardest task of all, but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now. mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the champions league, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. it is a priceless commodity. no-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by mourinho. he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people, and maybe he can appear that way, but he has the silverware to back up the talk. mourinho doesnt simply talk a good game - hes won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto. some may criticise his talk, but the words are backed up with actions. ive also found him to be very realistic whenever ive heard him. hes spent a lot of money and it seems to be working, and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked. the buys are now integrating, and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension.  in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics, and yet he was winning games. you cannot win titles early on in the season, but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital. i also thought the criticism was very harsh, because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful. now they are taking those chances, have the double threat of robben and damien duff, and things are looking good. i just wonder if they lack a predator, particularly with didier drogba injured. he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined, but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title. chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league. i felt they would never have a better chance than last season, but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season. it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things, but his life will be made easier by the size of chelseas squad. i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season, even when arsenal were flying at the start, and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind.  if anything, what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions. and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenals rocky defensive display at spurs, even though they ran out 5-4 winners. mourinho had his say on that game, complaining: ""five-four is a hockey score, not a football score. ""in a three-against-three training match, if the score reaches 5-4 i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly. ""so to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful.""  on a more serious note, it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal. much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan, but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenals defence. confidence is a crucial factor in defending. when you start conceding goals, you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area. you think ""oh no"" - then find your worst fears confirmed. arsenal need to reverse the process, with or without campbell, and get some clean sheets on the board. but the return of campbell is key. he solidifies the unit, has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck. he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him. campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit. chelsea have no such problems at present, which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season."

""it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality."" world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for £4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russians arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. ""the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,"" he said.  ""everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. ""since that game in 2000, chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season."" desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france, the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan, two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar, alongside the likes of frank lebeouf, josep guardiola, titi camara, gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta. ""im happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level,"" he said. ""i made a vow to costacurta that as long as he plays, i will continue to play. ""and its amazing that paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time."""
146,football093.txt,"celtic make late bid for bellamy  newcastle striker craig bellamy is discussing a possible short-term loan move to celtic, bbc sport understands.  the welsh striker has rejected a move to birmingham after falling out with magpies manager graeme souness. the toon boss vowed bellamy would not play again after a bitter row over his exclusion for the game against arsenal. celtic are in no position to match birminghams £6m offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit bellamy while he considers his future. according to bellamys agent, the player dismissed a permanent move to birmingham. and it is unlikely that newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another premiership club.  bellamy was fined two weeks wages after a live tv interview in which he accused souness of lying, following a very public dispute about what position bellamy should play in the side. souness said: ""he cant play for me ever again. he has been a disruptive influence from the minute i walked into this football club.

""thats not good enough for a striker at a club like this. ""we need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis.""  bellamy turned down a move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after a disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. earlier in the week, souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after bellamy accused him of lying.  ""there are certain things you can forgive and forget,"" said souness. ""but if id been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job i have after newcastle."" he could then return to st james park - and he says that he wants to. however, it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in charge."

""we got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous."" shearers goal moved him within 12 of jackie milburns club scoring record of 200 for the magpies. but souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season.

""he struck the ball very well - he always has done - and i think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper."" souness also paid tribute to laurent robert, who was at the heart of much of uniteds attacking play.

179,rugby088.txt,"all black magic: new zealand rugby  playing colours:  all black  the haka and more!  the all blacks  charles john munro discovered rugby at londons christ college, and on his return to nelson he staged new zealands first game. nelson town met nelson college on 14 may, 1870, the town triumphing by two goals to nil, instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the countrys sporting passions. the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread, the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sports warrior ethos. in 1888 a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia, and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex-pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team.  twenty-two maori and four pakiha formed the new zealand native team, who played a total of 107 matches in new zealand, australia and the uk. the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society, even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the maori war dance, the haka! the other great symbol of new zealand rugby, the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast, was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in 1893. new zealand played their first international against australia in 1903, the kiwis triumphing 22-3 in sydney, and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time. the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain, david revell bedell-sivright, created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude. the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in wellington, sparking great celebrations across the country, but bedell-sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk.  their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official new zealand tour to europe. the tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking, inventive approach, but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a roving forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. the tactic was effective, two late tries seeing the kiwis to a 12-7 win over scotland, before ireland were despatched 15-0 in dublin. a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of england. new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first golden age, and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at cardiff arms park, but post-match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas. dallas said that deans was tackled short, but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed: ""i did score that try in cardiff.""  four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed all golds rugby league side soon after the tour, but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo-welsh touring team in 1908. the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-test series, starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the all blacks inclusion of maori players. the awesome 1924-5 all black tourists became known as the invincibles after winning all 30 of their games in france, britain and ireland, including a crushing 19-0 victory over wales at st helens. despite their success, the all blacks 2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times, and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928. employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the new zealand rover system for the first time, south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two-all. the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour (a series won 3-1 by new zealand), the lions manager describing the tactic as cheating, prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.  the all blacks 1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage, schoolboy half-backs hayden tanner and willie davies. a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 13-12, although the winning try from geoffrey rees-jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build-up. new zealands next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to cardiff and drew 6-6 at swansea. the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park, but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous, match-winning try. the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations, before a 19-5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller. new zealand built from that tour, and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.  that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at rodney parade. wilson whinnerays side rallied to beat wales 6-0, their first win at the arms park in four attempts, and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour, but when they returned home the first question put to them was: ""what happened in newport?"" the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales, as they beat the full wales team 13-6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969, the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team.  a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the all blacks, a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of 1971.  james guided llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at stradey park, though, and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23-11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. new zealand defeated a wales xv 12-3 at the arms park in a non-cap game in 1974, but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.  wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line-out. television pictures clearly showed that he dived, but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty, duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 13-12 win. since that infamous game, the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. a crushing 23-3 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby unions 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 49-6 in brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural world cup. the kiwis went on to claim the cup, and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of new zealand.  a young, talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners, but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games, wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game, but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of wales best players - chose to head north to rugby league.  a 34-9 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989, and at the 1995 world cup wales big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg. a crushing 42-7 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997, and as wales misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen. there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game, but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiffs new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.  a bruising 55-3 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup, but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope. wales were given no chance going into the game, but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. new zealand rallied to a 53-37 win, but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen, coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. they have a chance, but clearly history is not on their side."

""if he has to talk, he talks. if he wants to make a newspaper article, he makes a newspaper article.

""the return is on 1 february and they will come out with another diatribe.

251,cricket051.txt,"scotland take small step into the big time  there was no winners cheque on offer and no increase in status, just a trip to sharjah, a shiny trophy and the prestige of being considered the 11th-best team in world cricket.  but scotland were still celebrating heartily after winning the icc intercontinental cup, beating kenya and canada in the final stages in the united arab emirates. men in suits can talk for as long as they like about infrastructure and development pathways, but sport is about winning, and scotland came through where it mattered. pace bowler john blain, who was man of the match in the final after taking seven wickets, fully realised the importance of an innings victory over canada. ""weve been moving on for a number of years now, narrowly missing out on the world cup but this is the next-best thing,"" he told bbc sport. ""weve always been confident of what ability we have but its about getting results."" the victory means more than some silverware for the cabinet, however, for a team that appeared in the 1999 world cup but has not made highlight reels since. the majority of the side are still amateurs and, as blain pointed out: ""its very difficult for guys to go from the world cup back to their jobs and keep the standard up.""  the international cricket council is keen to improve the strength and depth behind the 10 test-playing nations, and this is just a part of its development programme. five associate member countries will appear in the 2007 world cup and the authorities are keen they should provide more than a second-round bye for the bigger sides. senior coach bob woolmer suggested that the three-day format would help hone skills for the limited-overs game. blain gives the idea the thumbs-up but also believes scotlands exposure to english county crickets national league (ncl) has helped. ""the guys have come here and played the cricket that theyve been playing the last couple of years in the ncl but in a longer version of the game,"" he said. ""theyve learned how to be ruthless and go for the victory."" with some controversy, this tournament was given first-class status, although only a handful of players - including blain and durhams gavin hamilton - normally play at that level.  with kenya lacking 13 players because of a pay dispute and canada losing world cup star john davison to australian domestic duty, the standard was below county level. however, blain argued: ""ive had seven-wicket hauls in county cricket but this must rate among them - its international cricket and its the top of the tree."" this win will help strengthen scotlands claim for full-time one-day international status, saving them from the qualification process. they will have to prove themselves again next april when the icc trophy in ireland will act as a world cup qualifier but blain believes consistency is building. ""results are now starting to show. we have a squad of boys who can compete,"" he continued. ""weve got more exposure now and the standard has moved on fantastically, which will stand us in good stead when we go on to the qualifiers."" the intercontinental cup is not an end in itself but a significant milestone along the way."
252,cricket045.txt,"australia dominate india  third test, nagpur, day two (stumps): australia 398 v india 146-5  the home side closed on 146-5, 252 runs in arrears and still 53 short of avoiding the follow-on. glenn mcgrath, playing in his 100th test, took 2-18 in 20 overs as mohammad kaif (47 not out) propped up an innings that crawled at two runs per over. australia were earlier dismissed for 398, with michael clarke falling to zaheer khan (4-95) nine short of a ton. india did not take long in wrapping up australias innings at the start of the day, claiming the three remaining overnight wickets for 36 runs. jason gillespie, lbw to zaheer, and kasprowicz, bowled by agit agarkar, both fell cheaply, leaving mcgrath as clarkes last hope of a second test century. the veteran enjoyed his stay at the crease with two hooked boundaries, and in the end it was he who remained unbeaten when clarke edged behind to end an entertaining knock that included 13 boundaries.  india were given a typically blustery start by virender sehwag, who took four boundaries off gillespies first over. it forced skipper adam gilchrist to protect the boundary with a sweeper after just five overs, but having forced australia on the defensive sehwag soon gave his wicket away. flashing hard at mcgrath, the opener became the aussie pacemans 447th victim when edging into the gloves of the athletic gilchrist, diving high to his right. gillespie, belted out of the attack by sehwag, returned from the other end and struck immediately to have aakash chopra caught by warne at slip for eight.  it left india 35-2 at lunch, and a very quiet period followed the interval as rahul dravid and the returning sachin tendulkar tried to block india to parity. the pair put on 15 runs in one ball shy of 13 dawdling overs before tendulkar was trapped in front of stumps by gillespie (2-47) for eight. the grassy nagpur pitch meant shane warnes introduction was delayed until the 36th over, but two balls were all it took for the test crickets leading wicket-taker to add to his tally. in having vvs laxman caught by clarke in gully, warne ousted him for the third time this series and reduced india to a perilous 75-4 in the process. dravids stay at the crease was a lengthy one but largely unproductive, and after consuming 140 balls for 21 runs he edged mcgrath to slip. it was a predictable end after the veteran paceman had worked indias stand-in skipper over with an array of balls which leapt off the seam on a pitch more akin to australian grounds.  at 103-5 india looked vulnerable, but kaif and parthiv patel - fresh from their century stand in the second test - showed heart in the fading light. it was not plain sailing for kaif - a spurned run-out chance and a catch off a no-ball offered two reprieves - but he grew into his task and even managed a six off warne over long-off. although indias sixth wicket offered the home side hope, australia were in a strong position to push for the victory that would award them a first series victory in india for 35 years.  a chopra, v sehwag, r dravid (capt), s r tendulkar v v s laxman, m kaif, p a patel (wkt), a b agarkar, a kumble m kartik, z khan.  m l hayden, j l langer, s m katich, d r martyn d s lehmann, m j clarke, a c gilchrist (capt, wkt), s k warne m s kasprowicz, j n gillespie, g d mcgrath.  aleem dar, d r shepherd."
253,cricket119.txt,"england need to regroup  south africa duly levelled the series in mid-afternoon when englands unlikely top scorer, steve harmison, was caught in the gully for 42.  england now have three days of relaxation in cape town in which to contemplate their first defeat in 14 matches before heading to johannesburg for the fourth test. coach duncan fletchers main problem is that only a handful of players are currently pulling their weight. of the bowlers, matthew hoggard is plugging away manfully, but he and andrew flintoff appear to be the only seam bowlers michael vaughan feels he can trust at present. simon jones is bowling steadily enough, yet vaughan seems to bring him on only as a last resort while harmison remains a shadow of the bowler who, until this tour, topped the world rankings. spinner ashley giles was more consistent in cape town than in the previous test, but rarely looked threatening. the lack of application of the batsmen, however, has been the principle reason for england having lost their lead. andrew strauss and marcus trescothick can be excused criticism, but even they would admit that, along with all the others, their wickets have been given away far too easily.  what must really frustrate fletcher is that south africas bowling attack is little more than workmanlike, and should not have dismissed england for 139 in their first innings in durban and 163 in the first innings here. on a wearing pitch, they still needed 124 overs to bowl england out a second time, and the last wicket pair of harmison and hoggard were able to add 51 with little difficulty. at least the news of andrew flintoffs injury is encouraging. an mri scan revealed that his problem is an abdominal strain, rather than intercostal. had it been the latter, it would have ended his tour at a stroke, but the belief now is that, with treatment, he should be fit to bowl in johannesburg. if the injury does not recover in time, england face the nightmare of trying to choose a balanced team. mark butchers prognosis does not appear to be as promising. he is wearing a cast on his left wrist which will be removed next week, but time seems to be running out for him. neutral observers still believe that england are the better team, but having avoided defeat in durban and scored a resounding victory here, south africa now have the force with them."

255,football223.txt,"the wonder of ronaldinho  ronaldinho has the most famous smile in football - but it is the grins his incredible talent has put on the faces of fans that ensured he picked up the world player of the year award on monday night.  the brazilian landed the prize ahead of strikers thierry henry of arsenal and ac milans andriy shevchenko after a year in which his dancing feet dazzled defenders and delighted fans. henry and shevchenko led their clubs to the league titles in england and italy while ronaldinho ended last season trophy-less. but while ronaldinhos achievements may not have won him any medals, they have won him the hearts of a football world. he has turned despair into delight at barcelona since deciding to move to the nou camp instead of manchester united and, in the process, brought a joy back to the sport. barcelona were an ailing club thirsty for former glories to be restored as they hung heavily in the shadows of the ""galacticos"" of arch-rivals real madrid.  but the arrival of ronaldinho in july 2003 has spearheaded a rapid rise which now sees the catalan club playing the kind of flamboyant football encapsulated by the dashing skills of their playmaker and inspiration. he has fans on the edge of their seats as they wonder what marvels the boy from brazil will produce to amaze them. ronaldinhos magic rarely disappoints and, while he possesses all the feints, step-overs, shoulder-drops and vision one could wish for, he also has the crucial ability of complementing his skills with an end product. his victory in fifas annual vote may be hard for henry and shevchenko, who have amazed with their exploits, but ronaldinho just has that little extra va-va voom. ronaldinho can add the award to the world cup winners medal he earned with brazil at the 2002 world cup and the 1999 copa america title.  ronaldinho - full name ronaldo de assis moreira - has come a long way from his humble origins in porto allegre, where he was spotted by his hometown club gremio at the age of 18. his flamboyance and vision was a key factor as brazil won the world under-17 title in 1997, and in 1999 he captured the attention of then-brazil coach wanderley luxemburgo with 15 goals in 14 matches for gremio. ronaldinho made his international debut that year and announced himself on the world stage with a sensational solo effort against venezuela in the copa america, which brazil went on to win. a protracted transfer saga saw him move to paris st germain where his relationship with the french club was far from harmonious, and coach luis fernandez was not amused when he turned up late following a trip home at christmas. there was also discontent about the samba stars penchant for dancing at parisian night spots as much as waltzing past opponents.  but barcelona were confirmed admirers and a year later his club career - which had been somewhat grounded - really took off after a move to spain. sir alex ferguson had been confident of tempting him to manchester united, but the lure of the nou camp was too strong. things did not go that well at the start of his life in spain, but following the winter break, ronaldinho and barcelona hit top gear, finishing the campaign strongly and earning a champions league place.  transfer speculation has followed him throughout his young career and almost inevitably he was linked with chelsea this summer. but even the blues billionaire owner roman abramovich could not prise him away from barca, who rewarded him with an improved contract with a buy-out clause of £100m."

261,rugby128.txt,"wales hails new superstar  one game into his six nations career, and gavin henson is already a welsh legend.  a mesmeric display against england, topped off by his howitzer of a match-winning penalty, has secured life membership of that particular club. at 23, henson has the rugby world at his silver-booted feet. and if his natural self-assurance and swagger is shared by his wales team-mates, then a full-blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the valleys. the ""red dragonhood"" subdued the ""red rose army"" in most areas of the field, but hensons stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others. he announced himself in the games opening salvo with a ""welcome to cardiff"" greeting for mark cueto on the gain line. and his defence was a major feature of the match, his principal victim poor old, or rather young, mathew tait. the england centre will have spent his 19th birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once, but twice, by hensons all-enveloping tackles.  the second time, after the interval, single-handedly lifted the record millennium stadium crowd at a time when england were starting to show menace. showing awesome strength, henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid-air, a master predator toying with his helpless prey, savouring the kill. his kicking game also prospered, particularly when he moved to full-back for 10 minutes either side of half-time when his captain gareth thomas was in the sin-bin. one huge clearance from taits kick sent england retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half. henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for shane williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing jamie noon to fumble the ball into touch. he also had a hand in the games only try, finished superbly by williams, and might have scored himself on the half-hour as he glided into space, only to be scragged by tait. henson was twice repelled as wales laid siege to the english line after charlie hodgsons penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time. but he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din, and the outcome of the match fell to him. replacement gareth cooper made the most of a poor welsh scrum by chipping into space, where jason robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle.  five metres in from the right touchline, 44 metres out, it was not a kick stephen jones, who had seen a long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar, would have approached with confidence. ""it was out of steves range but i looked at gavin, and he gave me a reassuring nod,"" said thomas. henson, surveying his date with destiny, positively relished the responsibility, and the chance to make himself a hero. without further ado, he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of english dominance and 12 years of waiting in cardiff. ""i knew i was going to get it before i even took the kick,"" he said later, his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape. ""i have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasnt a problem."" there were still four minutes for wales to hold out, and the frenzy was such that henson could not even hear jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away. but it was wales who finished the game on the attack, almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax. ""just do it"" implored the front page headline on saturdays western mail newspaper. and, thanks to henson, wales did."

""i dont think you can ever say never,"" said woodward. ""but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby."" dallaglio, back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added: ""the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. ""my job, along with all the other senior representatives, is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. ""if you are not playing international rugby then its still a step up to test rugby. its definitely a disadvantage.  ""i think its absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries."" woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open. ""it is an open book,"" he said. ""there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries."" and following the all blacks impressive displays in europe in recent weeks, including a 45-6 humiliation of france, woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge. ""their performance in particular against france was simply awesome,"" said the lions coach. ""certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five, but theyre a very powerful unit."" with his customary thoroughness, woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.  as a result, woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots. ""scotlands recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances. ""eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions."" and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call, provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems. ""i took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasnt fit and went on the trip. ""every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip. ""i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat."""
266,football025.txt,"time to get tough on friendlies?  for an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.  i would say its 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil. often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole teams worth. the debate will rage on, and im not sure there is a satisfactory solution. one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith. the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts. it is the sort of move you would expect from walter, who is a canny manager.  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers. if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever. john toshack has his first game in charge of wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary. he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results. its extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. if you win, people forget them, but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. englands game against holland is a good example. it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson. but you have got to remember sven-goran erikssons side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played.  the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress. for the club managers, it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed."

""at the time you dont think anything of it but then afterwards you start to put two and two together, with events that happened afterwards."" england captain nasser hussain put the south africans in after winning the toss, and was given an early reward, of a purely cricketing nature, when gary kirsten edged darren gough to second slip for a duck in the first over.  cronje also fell to gough for a duck as the home side closed the first day 155-6. the next three days were then wiped out competely due to a combination of rain and damp ground conditions before cronje approached hussain with a suggestion to manufacture a result. south africa had already secured the series having won in johannesburg and cape town, but cronje (and his friends) wanted to create some interest in the final day at centurion. the idea was for each side to forfeit an innings each, leaving the tourists with a run chase, so south africa reached 248-8 on the final morning to set england 249 from 76 overs. kirsten was one of several players opposed to the move, as he explained to bbc sport. ""hansie came up to us in the changing room on the last day and said: im keen to forfeit the innings and set the total.  ""he asked the team and there was a mixed reception. ""some of the guys felt we didnt want to give england a chance of winning - you dont mess around with test matches - and some said nothing! ""hansie just decided, and maybe we know why in hindsight, to go for it but there was quite a bit of resistance and some of the guys didnt think it was a good idea at all."" englands 12th man that day was phil tufnell, who recalled: ""everyone thought it was a very good gesture in the spirit of the game. ""the game had meandered along and all of a sudden it was like an old fashioned three-day county game and we were having a chase."" whatever the reasons - later it emerged that cronjes part had been simply to ensure against a draw - it led to a fascinating cricket match.  england needed six from the final seven balls and yorkshire tailenders chris silverwood and darren gough both hit boundaries to give them a two-wicket victory. ""it ended as a great day for cricket,"" kirsten conceded. ""one could argue it was good for people who had been frustrated having not watched any cricket and suddenly got a great last day. ""but from a players point of view youve worked so hard for three months trying to win a test series that you dont give test matches away, or create the opportunity to make it easy to win one."" tufnell has favourable memories of cronje, who played county cricket for leicestershire in the 1990s.

""he always came and said hi and seemed a very intelligent captain, a good competitor and a good ambassador for south african cricket."" kirsten too recalls some positive images of cronje.

317,football226.txt,"taking the highs with the lows  i thought we gave a tremendous performance against arsenal last week.  and i have to say that anyone who saw our disallowed goal must realise there is no way it should ever have been ruled out. it was interesting to hear the tv pundits ask if it was disallowed because dennis bergkamp had been sent off moments before. i was surprised by the number of people who questioned whether the referee was trying to level things out. the major decision, which defeated me really, was the caution given to cesc fabregas for his tackle on nick montgomery. to me, that should have been a straight red card. yet all i saw in the papers were accusations that danny cullip allegedly stamped on fabregas. but when i watch it back, i dont see anything wrong there at all. as ive said in the past, you dont seem to get the rub of the green when youre a lower league club in these competitions.  but we have to go into the replay without any fear and thats what will happen come tuesday. the only thing we can learn from arsenals champions league defeat against bayern munich is that we were even worse in our loss at plymouth. we got beaten 3-0 and never looked like scoring! at least arsenal got a goal and have a chance of winning at home in the second leg - and theyve done that in the past. whether theyll now want to risk their big stars on tuesday against us, knowing they need to beat bayern 2-0 a week later, is debatable. unfortunately, we have not got a squad big enough to be able to rotate. and were very thin on the ground for the replay - it looks like well be missing three or four of our better players. we dont know if goalkeeper paddy kenny will be okay after being carried off against plymouth, and cullip will be suspended. however, although the cup is diverting our attention, the chances are we wont win it.  so the league has to be our priority. an even more important match than the one against arsenal comes on saturday when we have to beat the championships bottom club rotherham. and i will be reiterating to my players that we have 14 games left in the league and we have to start winning if we want to be in the play-offs. weve lost four in a row in the league now, but we havent got time to feel sorry for ourselves."

321,football024.txt,"parry relishes anfield challenge  bbc sport reflects on the future for liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive rick parry.  chief executive parry is the man at the helm as liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history. parry has to deliver a new 60,000-seat stadium in stanley park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above £120m. he is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore liverpool to their place at european footballs top table. but it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with parry, who has forged a reputation as one of footballs most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling premier league.  liverpool have not won the championship since 1990, a fact that causes deep discomfort inside anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of chelsea, manchester united and arsenal. throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard, and you can see parry is a man with a lot on his plate. but in the comfort of a conference room deep inside liverpools heartbeat - the kop end - parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead. he only dodged one question - when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool, a polite smile deflected the inquiry. but to his credit, he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business.  by business he means becoming title challengers again, and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to liverpool is parrys mission. parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez. and his enthusiasm for the spaniards personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold. benitezs early work has given parry renewed optimism about the years ahead. but it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations. this will not come as news to parry, a lifelong liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting...  captain gerrard is central to liverpools plans and parrys insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent. as ever, the player will have the final say, and parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish.  in terms of the search for new investment, hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march 2004. thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra came and went, while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan. morgan had a succession of bids rejected, having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium. bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool, and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.  morgan, however, has had no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december, blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his £70m offer. he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool. morgan will certainly not be making another call. so speculation continues about the new benefactor, with trails leading to the middle east and america, but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield.  parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpools future, but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea. he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium. parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in north london that has re-shaped liverpools thinking.  liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of arsenals stunning £100m deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape. parry labelled the deal ""an eye-opener"" and admits liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities. he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just anfield, but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.  i would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. as for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?  £50m for gerrard? i dont care who you are, the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go, despite gerrards quality.  through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which i think is the right thing to do.  critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash.  £50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrards transfer for any fee over £35m.  parrys statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry.  i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.  the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly, if he isnt, then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football."

""it doesnt matter if its £30m, £40m or £50m, we will not accept offers. but we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep steven against his will."" on the subject of liverpools finances, parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.  and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan. parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league. there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard.  on the subject of liverpools captain and prize asset, parry revealed real madrid  did  ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes. he said: ""they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes, but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale."" but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season, parry said: ""i sincerely hope he will be. steven knows my views. he knows rafas views. ""we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him. we crave success as much as he does. we know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that.  ""i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than hed like to do anything else. ""we all want to see progress by next season. hes not alone in that. there are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim."" it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. ""there have been a lot of open secrets about steven, most of which have been complete myths. it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. we didnt had an offer last summer,"" parry explained. ""we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him. in reality it didnt go beyond that. ""maybe there will be an offer in the summer. maybe there wont.  ""our position is we want steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. ""you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will. that just doesnt work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda. you can forget that."" parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpools new stadium in stanley park, which is set to open in 2007. and he confessed arsenals £100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the anfield club serious food for thought. he said: ""i have to say historically it is something i have been against, and i have been on record as saying that, but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.  ""i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating. ""but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow - thats interesting. ""my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium."" some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but parry countered: ""i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. ""if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? time will tell. ""i think the stadium will always be anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? i think it would be remiss not to. ""thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but i think it is clearly something we have to explore.""  on the subject of possible new investment, parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the middle east. that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. he also accused liverpool of using him as ""a stalking horse"" to attract other bids, but parry explained: ""steve has never been used as a stalking horse. theres no need, and that is not the way we do business. ""we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004. i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen.

332,football224.txt,"2004 - a year to remember  club football in south america continues to suffer from the continents economic crisis.  the best players are lured across the atlantic - 900 players left brazil alone in 2004. and crowds are low, with money tight and the fear of violence proving a powerful incentive to stay at home. the average attendance in this years brazilian championship was a record low of 8,139. furthermore, in 2004 no new talent exploded on the continent with quite the same force as diego, robinho and carlos tevez in the two previous years. there is no doubt that the highlight of south americas footballing year has to come from the international game. there were some dramatic tournaments in 2004. the copa america, held in peru last july, could hardly have come to a more exciting conclusion. with the last kick of the final brazil scored one of the most decisive equalising goals in the history of football.  argentina thought they had the game won and were in no state to take penalties when adrianos 93rd-minute blast forced a shoot-out. earlier in the year there was intense disappointment for brazil when they amazingly failed to qualify for the olympic football tournament. the gold medal is the only title they lack but they will have to wait four more years after missing out on the two qualification slots up for grabs in south americas under-23 championships, held in chile in january. argentina and paraguay made it through and went on to secure gold and silver in athens. these tournaments were terrific but the real highlights of the year in south american football could only come from the world cup qualification campaign. the reason? it is the only time that all the great players come back home and play competitive matches in front of their own fans. i well remember getting a shiver down my spine awaiting the kick-off of the match between brazil and argentina at the start of june. euro 2004 was about to get under way. the thought struck me that the accumulation of talent on the belo horizonte pitch was at least as outstanding as that about to go into action in portugal. for 90 minutes brazil was the capital of the football world. ronaldo obviously felt the sense of occasion.  he will probably never play a bigger match in brazil and it was taking place in the stadium where he had made his name over a decade earlier. he was unstoppable, suffering and scoring three penalties in brazils 3-1 win. if ronaldos performance was the individual highlight of the year, my collective prize goes to argentina in a match they played a few months later. in october i was down in buenos aires to see their first match under new coach jose pekerman. nerves were settled with an early goal and old rivals uruguay were blasted away. soon after half-time argentina were four up and although uruguay hit back with two consolation goals, it was the performance of the hosts that lingers in the memory. argentinas goals were magnificent team efforts involving all of the fundamentals of well-played football. the ball moved quickly around the field, with plenty of running off the ball to provide options and lots of crisp, accurate passing, mixing long and short to find gaps in the defence. the crowd responded in fine style, creating the kind of atmosphere familiar to all those old enough to remember the 1978 world cup. these, then, were my highlights of 2004. with seven vital rounds of world cup qualifiers scheduled for next year, south american football should come up with much more to celebrate in 2005."

347,atheletics066.txt,"britain boosted by holmes double  athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals.  kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games. holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope, paula radcliffe, dropped out of the marathon and then the 10,000m. britains mens 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. holmes had started the year in disappointing style, falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. just five days later, the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb, it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games.  the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10,000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining.  but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in novembers new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british mens olympic squad after a poor start to the games.  it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell, jason gardener, marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britains first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and, just like holmes, finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gbs athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003.  but it was a different story for britains defending champion denise lewis, who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis, who was troubled by injury, has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze.  and backleys departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey, who came fourth in athens.  the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly, the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games, greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.  kenteris, the 200m champion in 2000, and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games, adrian annus (hammer), robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol.  the fallout from the thg scandal, which rocked the sport in 2003, continued to impact in olympic year. britains 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg.  american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. moroccos hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5,000m.  and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon, there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut."

365,cricket080.txt,"england left in tatters in durban  tea, day one: england: 125-8  graham thorpe was trapped lbw, andrew flintoff looped a catch to square-leg, michael vaughan fell plumb lbw and geraint jones hooked into the deep. marcus trescothick was the first to go after england lost the toss, caught behind off makhaya ntini (3-41). mark butcher then played on and andrew strauss was caught at mid-off for 25.  pollock is given the task of capturing the final two england wickets.  england 125-8  an authentic boundary next ball, lashed over cover for four more.  next ball jones tries to duck a bouncer and the ball barely gets above stump height, glancing the top of his head and bringing four leg byes.  jones stands up to steyn and pushes through the gap at mid-off for two.  boje tosses one up from over the wicket and jones has a dart at it, not finding the middle of the bat but smearing through a vacant mid-on for a single.  after the pace barrage, boje returns and hoggard finds a single to leave new man simon jones on strike.  the giles vigil ends in disappointing fashion as, severely hampered, he hooks at steyn and the man at deep square-leg does not have to move.  favouring the back foot as steyn continues to steam in, hoggard is glad to see one of fullish length that he can push out for a single.  after a single is scrambled, hoggard moves into the firing line and just manages to avoid a rapidly rising bouncer.  another part of unprotected giles anatomy is battered at 85mph, steyns skidding short one catching him in the armpit.  hoggard jabs down at the final moment to keep out a yorker from kallis that was destined for the timbers.  an appeal begun only by the keeper for caught behind against giles down the legside increases a little in volume, but darrel hair is not impressed.  hoggard does not know too much about a full and fast delivery, which he inside edges to fine-leg for a single.  : giles hooks uncomfortably again with one hand off the bat, but the single gives him temporary reprieve from the hostile steyn.  the return of kallis is warmly greeted by giles, who clips a loosener neatly off his pads for four.  matthew hoggard is the latest casualty, another short one from the aggressive steyn thwacking into his arm guard.  the next ball is also short and giles plays an unconvincing hook, with one hand coming off the bat, but some contact is made and giles is grateful to stutter through for a single.  giles is thumped again by another short one.  giles ducks into a brutal low bouncer from steyn, the ball crashes into his elbow and loops over the slip for four leg byes.  steyn returns for pollock as south africa look to wrap up the innings.  the hook proves to be the undoing of jones, who picks out rudolph in the deep off ntini.  jones edges low through a gap where fourth slip would have been, bringing four urgently needed runs for england.  another hook goes high into the space in front of square, but determined fielding from rudolph restricts jones to two.  persisting with the hook shot, jones is fully in control but can only get a single to deep square-leg off pollock.  jones hooks uppishly at ntini and is within 10 yards of carrying to the fielder on the fine-leg boundary.  aiming an expansive drive into the off-side he gets an inside edge and escapes with a single.  jones pummels a cut shot off pollock into the boards for his second four.  vaughan is rapped on the pads bang in front by a skidding delivery from ntini and umpire taufel confirms his worst fears.  pollock unsettles vaughan with a bouncer that follows him and catches the glove.  a controlled thick edge from jones finds the gap between third slip and gully and races for four.  ntini returns, his first delivery down the legside and easily turned for a single by vaughan.  geraint jones picks up a short one from pollock and the ball soars over the ropes for the maximum to open the wicketkeepers account in emphatic fashion.  vaughan rocks back to guide a forcing shot for a much needed boundary off boje.  flintoff is beaten for pace by pollock and his hook shot loops up tamely off the splice to square leg to leave his team in turmoil.  vaughan appears to lose sight of a short one from pollock, and having planned to leave it fends it awkwardly with the glove, before scrambling through for a risky single.  vaughan is able to pinch a single as his gentle push on the off side defeats the fielder on the bounce.  thorpe is trapped plumb in front by the metronomic pollock.  boje resumes after the interval, vaughan crashes one into jacques rudolph at silly point but slices the next ball through gully for four.  england 58-3  vaughan and thorpe get through safely to lunch but know that much more will be required this afternoon.  vaughan, badly needing to play a major innings, strikes a fluent boundary off boje.  kallis switches ends and produces a maiden as england look towards the safety of the luncheon interval.  new man graham thorpe clips a single from the final ball of the over.  the single proves effective as key man strauss takes the strike and lofts a catch to extra cover, where ntini swoops low to cap a fine morning for the home side.  boje finds some early spin with his third delivery and catches the edge of vaughans bat as the england captain pushes forward, but de villiers spills the chance and the ball falls to safety.  kallis is replaced after two overs and the spin of nicky boje is tried 13 minutes before lunch.  there is nothing to stop a strauss cut shot which brings up the england 50 in the 24th over.  strauss is denied a certain boundary when his pull shot strikes square-leg umpire simon taufel.  kallis escapes with a maiden as a sumptuous looking drive from vaughan goes straight to the ubiquitous amla in the covers.  strauss strokes the next ball gloriously down the ground for his fourth boundary.  vaughan pirouettes to pull steyn stylishly but only for a single as the distinctive figure of amla fields on the square-leg fence.  strauss eases the pressure a little by bisecting the field with a trademark drive to the boundary, as kallis struggles to find his rhythm early on.  jacques kallis is introduced, having been unable to bowl in the first test or in india, his first delivery is easily clipped into the legside for vaughans first run.  more conviction in this pull shot from strauss, and steyn is dispatched to the boundary.  just a single from the over, a hook from strauss, who moves to nine.  michael vaughan is given a bouncer first up and survives an optimistic shout for lbw.  an inside edge onto the stumps off steyn ends butchers innings in disappointing fashion again.  a nicely timed cover drive brings butcher three runs, with the intrepid amla cutting the ball off a yard inside the ropes.  ntini replaces pollock, who is left to fume in the outfield, his face a light shade of crimson.  steyn completes his second maiden, restricting butcher with an accurate off-stump line.  pollock hurls the ball back at strauss and throws in a few choice words for good measure.  the extra bounce of durban provides some uncertainty for strauss, an attempted cut and hook bouncing too high for him.  dale steyn is brought into the attack and herschelle gibbs provides him with a maiden with an agile diving stop in the gully.  butcher has to scamper through as he attempts a quick single to amla, who is quicker than perhaps the left-hander gives him credit for, luckily for him the throw is a fraction high.  an elegant drive on the tips of his toes from strauss through mid-off gives him his first boundary.  mark butcher nudges ntini into the legside to open his account.  pollock maintains the south africa stranglehold with another over offering no easy runs.  a stunning one-handed catch by de villiers off an inside edge ends trescothicks bright innings.  strauss gets down to ntinis end and is happy to receive a ball on the pads which he clips neatly away through square-leg for three.  trescothick slashes a wide one from ntini not quite out of the middle, but there is enough on it to clear nicky boje in the gully and race for four.  strauss looks for a single after driving to the right of hashim amla, but the fielder gets across well and ensures another maiden.  the wild ntini produces a maiden, the final ball of the over keeping low and bouncing in front of wicketkeeper ab de villiers.  strauss, keen to get off the mark, attempts a drive at pollock outside off-stump but misses and it is another maiden.  ntini asks the question of darrell hair but trescothick is a long way forward, he clips the next ball off his pads for two more.  another probing maiden from pollock, with strauss content to remain on nought and leave them outside his off-stump.  trescothick thumps the final ball of ntinis over through the covers into the boundary boards.  pollock maintains a tidy line outside off-stump to strauss, who is yet to get off the mark.  trescothick picks the gap at mid-off, punching ntini for the days first boundary.  ntini, bowling over the wicket, angles a short ball across trescothick, who does not take the bait.  pollock overpitches as trescothick gets the scoring under way for england with an off-drive for three runs.  graeme smith (captain), herschelle gibbs,

""it doesnt matter if its £30m, £40m or £50m, we will not accept offers. but we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep steven against his will."" on the subject of liverpools finances, parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.  and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan. parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league. there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard.  on the subject of liverpools captain and prize asset, parry revealed real madrid  did  ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes. he said: ""they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes, but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale."" but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season, parry said: ""i sincerely hope he will be. steven knows my views. he knows rafas views. ""we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him. we crave success as much as he does. we know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that.

""we all want to see progress by next season. hes not alone in that. there are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim."" it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. ""there have been a lot of open secrets about steven, most of which have been complete myths. it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. we didnt had an offer last summer,"" parry explained. ""we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him. in reality it didnt go beyond that. ""maybe there will be an offer in the summer. maybe there wont.  ""our position is we want steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. ""you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will. that just doesnt work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda. you can forget that."" parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpools new stadium in stanley park, which is set to open in 2007. and he confessed arsenals £100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the anfield club serious food for thought. he said: ""i have to say historically it is something i have been against, and i have been on record as saying that, but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.  ""i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating. ""but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow - thats interesting. ""my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium."" some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but parry countered: ""i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. ""if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? time will tell. ""i think the stadium will always be anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? i think it would be remiss not to. ""thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but i think it is clearly something we have to explore.""  on the subject of possible new investment, parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the middle east. that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. he also accused liverpool of using him as ""a stalking horse"" to attract other bids, but parry explained: ""steve has never been used as a stalking horse. theres no need, and that is not the way we do business. ""we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004. i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen. ""quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december, and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. we are still evaluating it.

""but the french have to get behind him and the team at lansdowne road."" following victories over south africa and australia in november, france were deemed by many to be the worlds leading side. but they were then trounced 45-6 by new zealand and only just beat scotland after the scots had a try disallowed in their six nations opener. it then took some woeful spot kicking from charlie hodgson and olly barkley to help them to victory against england at twickenham. &lt;  castaignede said: ""you cant say any of those results have eased the pressure on laporte. ""had englands kickers not been so bad, the position in the six nations would be very different now."" laporte has been criticised for frances negative tactics in their wins over scotland and england. but his side played a more free-flowing style against wales, making a mockery of the oppositions defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval. ""all the chat in france has been about how france will play against ireland,"" said castaignede ahead of the 12 march tie. ""everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against wales. but everyone also wants a win."" castaignede, a veteran of 43 international caps, admitted the french would go in as underdogs against ireland.  ""going to ireland is never easy but the way theyre playing right now, its harder than ever,"" said castaignede. ""theyre very experienced and dont often lose at home. theyve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break."" despite praising the irish he claimed the welsh had the upper hand in the six nations run-in. ""ireland have such a good pack but wales are something else on the break,"" he added. ""at the weekend they were simply awesome. as a frenchman it was disappointing to see, but you had to admire it. ""their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship."" the 30-year-old also tipped yann delaigue to start ahead of frederic michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in paris last weekend. ""delaigue played really well and admittedly michalak played well too,"" said castaignede. ""im just glad im not the one who has to make the decision."""

""this is not going to happen overnight, there are no miracle workers, but youre going in the right direction."" the 52-year-olds enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in america.

""if not, someone will come and take their place. theres only one number one spot and its lonely up there, but its got the best view."" in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britains great new hope, connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon. ""tim henman has a whole country on his shoulder,"" said connors. ""i dont know that pressure, but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level. ""someones going to have to come and take over from him (henman). if i was andrew murray, id embrace that. thats what we play for."" despite the emphasis on hard work, training and preparation, connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within. ""the passion i had, i dont know if you can find that,"" he admitted. ""i was also nuts. i say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court. ""it was the most important thing in the world for me, and to do that somethings got to be not right with you. there was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of 25,000 people.

405,rugby081.txt,"a year to remember for irish  there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most.  well, at least there used to one. now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow. it has been quite a year for the irish, and not just with eddie osullivans triple crown winning international outfit either. right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. but most of the kudos will go to osullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record. for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the rbs six nations. but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri-nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa, ireland finsihed the year on a high. the 18-12 victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in 1965. that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer. those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against france, were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. but the big one, of course, was the 19-13 defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf. the winning try was conceived in osullivans mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey. for me, the try of the championship. osullivans career is now in vertical take-off mode. it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway-based coach to head the lions test side. not only that, but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand.  there can be no doubt that irelands representation will be the biggest ever, albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. in brian odriscoll and paul oconnell, ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. gordon darcy, whose career began as a teenager back in 1999, finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament. but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland, the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. the under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider. the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to england in the six nations under-21 tournament. on the provincial front, leinster, for second year in succession, blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager. while ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was munster again flying the flag for the irish. looking to reach their third final, they went down 37-32 to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road. how wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel, and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybodys guess. ulster, meanwhile, just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game.  ulster, however, took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall. the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the celtic league. leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005, but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing. on the down side, irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under-19 world cup game in durban. that happened only 10 days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools cup success since 1977. the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character, doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in 1985, the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known londonderry ym player jim huey, coleraines jonathan hutchinson, and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole. they all passed away long before the full-time whistle."

""that is what i dont know."" at 34, holmes will also be aware that time is running out. us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson, a five-time olympic gold medallist, retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britains double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson. the physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for holmes, who has already admitted she ""doesnt like the training anymore."" whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on. holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race, she will not step onto the track. but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer, there are more prizes up for grabs. the day after completing her double in athens, the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title.  holmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled, such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki. there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains, nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens. on the other hand, if those achievements cannot be matched shouldnt they be at least shared and celebrated? ""you dont get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion,"" agreed cram. ""you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because its a fantastic feeling. ""i think deep down kelly wants to run. i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain.""  athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look kelly holmes tearing up the track again. after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. so, why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where, when or whether to even bother competing again? ""thats just kelly,"" explains cram. ""shes always been like that. ""she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now its headline news. ""kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions, whether she can be competitive, if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line. ""and if she decides not to run again, no-one is going to turn round and say youre making the wrong decision."""

""you look around and there are not too many other goalkeepers who you would think were better."" arsenal manager arsene wenger and his old trafford counterpart sir alex ferguson have tried in vain to find new players of a similar quality to replace david seaman and peter schmeichel. seaman was at arsenal for 13 years, while schmeichel was at old trafford for eight years and was hailed as the ""bargain of the century"" by ferguson after he signed him for £600,000. wilson and shilton have cited the lack of technique of the current generation but both agree they would have lehmann in goal ahead of almunia at arsenal. wilson explained: ""i would defend jens lehman last season because he was top of every stat going.  ""he had an absolutely phenomenal season but, unfortunately, a couple of big errors came in the champions league against chelsea and arsene is a hard taskmaster and so he suddenly started to change and take a real chance on the spaniard.

424,cricket107.txt,"england fail to finish job again  england have done their best throughout this series to suggest that they are vulnerable and, on a rain-hit third day at centurion, their batsmen did it again.  when michael vaughan horribly mis-pulled shaun pollock to square leg for a four-ball duck, england had lost three tame wickets for two runs in three overs. they seemed to be doing their best to keep the game open when they should have been doing their utmost to close it down. the first to go was marcus trescothick who was run out thanks to a misjudgement by andrew strauss. trescothick - at the non-strikers end - responded to strausss call when he drove makhaya ntini to straight mid off. but strauss suddenly changed his mind and as trescothick tried desperately to regain his ground, nicky boje swooped one-handed and threw the stumps down direct. robert key fell three overs later when he was caught behind down the leg side for a single. key glared at umpire bucknor when he raised his finger, and dragged himself off the ground, but replays suggested that he had, indeed, touched the ball.  four balls later, vaughan was caught and england were reeling on 29-3. andrew strauss then appeared completely to lose touch and, frankly, graham thorpe has only very occasionally been in form throughout the series. the left-handers scratched about, barely laying bat on ball, but somehow they survived, despite some very close lbw appeals. they managed to add 85 between the interruptions until strauss uncharacteristically chased a ball well wide of his off stump from andre nel and edged to boucher for 44. moments later, lightening drove the players from the ground. time is ticking away now and, with just two days to go, it would take something remarkable for the south africans to win the match from here. but englands fallibility, and their growing tendency to allow the opposition a second chance is something that should concern their supporters. everyone is anticipating a close, exciting ashes series in the summer. but, being completely honest, england will have to improve enormously on their efforts on this tour even to come close to threatening the aussies."

426,rugby122.txt,"paris promise raises welsh hopes  has there been a better six nations match than saturdays epic in paris?  and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978? those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris. welsh legend mervyn davies, a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as ""one of the great performances of the past three decades"". martyn williams, wales two-try scorer on the day, called it ""one of the most surreal games i have ever played in"". a crestfallen france coach, bernard laporte, simply observed: ""there was a french half and there was a welsh half"". and what a half it was for the red dragonhood, transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. but while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure, the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side. that they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time, then reverse it on the resumption, was remarkable enough. but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes, wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.  in international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory, the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. ten of the 22 on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced 33-5 in paris two years ago. but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup, wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.  ""the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class,"" noted coach mike ruddock. the likes of michael owen, gethin jenkins, dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summers lions tour to new zealand. and players like stephen jones, martyn williams, shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. jones, after his superb man-of-the-match display, observed that ""we are a very happy camp now"". ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that, ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. the  joie de vivre  so evident in that magical second-half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.  if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship, they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. similarly, wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. so on to murrayfield, where wales have not won on their last three visits. while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive, the players will set about the task of beating scotland. only then - with the visit of ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s, and writing their own names into welsh legend."

""he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened. however, i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily."" speaking immediately after the game, moyes said: ""i dont think it was a sending-off, i have been a centre-half in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.  ""not in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way. i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them.

428,football017.txt,"bridge could miss rest of season  chelsea left-back wayne bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle.  the england international, 24, was hurt in an innocuous challenge with alan shearer during the londoners fa cup defeat at newcastle on sunday. ""we think its a big injury,"" said jose mourinho, whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final. william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game. france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelseas 1-0 defeat at st james park.  with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus carlo cudicinis red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. cudicini would not have played against barcelona, but had been promised a game in the carling cup final, although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension. the manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to barcelona, even though he has few options to replace bridge at left-back.  celestine babayaro left the club in january, ironically to join newcastle, and although gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself. it could be that paulo ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with glen johnson, who ended the newcastle game in goal, playing on the right. youngsters ben hudell, joe keenan and sam tillen would be options should mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a champions league tie. bridges injury also means mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season.  ""he (bridge) has no chance of playing against barcelona, probably will not play against liverpool (in the carling cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season,"" he said. ""the medical department will try to do everything to recover gallas and duff. we will have to wait and see, but i wont cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on tuesday."" shearer said he was unsure what caused bridges injury. ""i dont know what happened."" he said. ""it was just a shame. i dont think we even touched each other. ""by all accounts its pretty serious. i went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best."" mourinho, whose team are chasing three trophies, has already lost winger arjen robben to a serious injury."
429,rugby108.txt,"healey targets england comeback  leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sundays return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations.  healey, who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 world cup, has been in good form in the tigers resurgence this season. ""i definitely still have ambitions to play for england,"" healey told the bbc. ""we will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me."" healey, who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career, has reverted to the wing, where he won most of his england caps. after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september, the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the tigers revival. ""i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before,"" he said.  ""i am basically playing where it best suits leicester. obviously i can play scrum-half, fly-half or full-back at a moments notice. ""but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things."" that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps-leicester trilogy in recent weeks. first, healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the tigers a 17-17 draw in their premiership meeting on 21 november. then, in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday, healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for martin corry to score the tigers third try. ""i caught cozzas eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full, but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score,"" healey recalled.  healey, twice a heineken cup winner, believes last sundays match was ""up there"" with some of the biggest club contests he has played in. ""it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game,"" he recalled. ""there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in. ""after about 15 minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way.""  the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come. but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed ""rugbys version of rocky ii"". ""there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done,"" he added. ""it was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result. ""i think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end i think we did. we have got to show the same desire again this week."""
430,football001.txt,"man utd stroll to cup win  wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter-finals.  rooney received a hostile reception, but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes free-kick. marcus bent missed evertons best chance when roy carroll, who was later struck by a missile, saved at his feet.  rooneys return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. and rooneys every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goal-line. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet ronaldos cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent, played onside by gabriel heintze, hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldos low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert, but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to evertons rescue three minutes later when rooneys big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through, but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes free-kick took a deflection, and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo, who reacted first to score easily. evertons problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooneys desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury-time when he outpaced stubbs, but once again martyn denied the england striker.  - manchester united coach sir alex ferguson: ""it was a fantastic performance by us. in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out.

457,rugby097.txt,"ireland 21-19 argentina  an injury-time dropped goal by ronan ogara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday.  ogara kicked all of irelands points, with two dropped goals and five penalties, to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. the pumas shocked the irish early on with a try from federico aramburu, and felipe contepomi kicked 14 points. the well-drilled and sharper pumas out-played and out-thought ireland in the early stages. indiscipline allowed argentinas leinster fly-half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked a ragged ireland with the first try of the game. ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts. ogara finally got ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. playing into a strong wind and rain, ireland continued to come second best in tight situations, and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. ogara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute, but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. the second-half started as the first had ended. ogara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute, but contepomi matched it three minutes later. the upper-body strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front, while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. ireland had to rely on ogaras boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. the munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. and irelands chance came when argentinas number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. ogara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow ogara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous, if fortuitous, comeback."
458,tennis071.txt,"nadal puts spain 2-0 up  result: nadal 6-7 (6/8) 6-2 7-6 (8/6) 6-2 roddick  spains rafael nadal beats andy roddick of the usa in the second singles match rubber of the 2004 davis cup final in seville. spain lead 1-0 after carlos moya beat mardy fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie.  nadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as spain go 2-0 up in the tie.  roddick holds serve to force nadal to serve for the match but the american surely cannot turn things around now.  nadal works roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points. one is enough, the spaniard secures the double-break and roddick is now teetering on the edge.  roddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired. nadal wins the game to love.  nadal steps up the pressure to break and spain have the early initiative in the fourth set.  nadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set.  roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third-set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set.  nadal earns the first mini-break in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour. a couple of stunning points follow, one where nadal chases down a roddick shot and turns into a passing winner. then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 4-4. roddick has two serves for the set but double-faults to take the score to 5-5. nadal saves a roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley - and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild.  nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go 15-40 and two set points up. roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game. the set will go to another tiebreak.  nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set.  roddick again holds on, despite some brilliant shot-making from his opponent.  nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick.  roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point.  nadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes 0-30 down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence. but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set.  roddicks serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set. three times, nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in. and roddicks grit pays off as he manages to hold.  roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point, which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold.  there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd. the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is. one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down. roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner.  the game passes the two-hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set.  now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it. it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked half-volley winner.  roddick is looking a little leaden-footed but does carve out a break point for himself. but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger.  roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles. he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points. the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level.  nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold.  two good serves put roddick 30-0 up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself 30-40 down. he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold.  roddicks level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak. the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point.  roddick double-faults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered, powering a passing winner past roddick.  nadal wins another tight game. neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set.  nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold.  nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first-set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second.  roddick double-faults to concede the first mini-break and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak. he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points. but roddick saves them and then earns one himself. nadal comes up with a down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on roddicks next set point.  nadals nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak. both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide.  a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points. the point of the match so far involves roddicks slam-dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally. on the very next point, nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud. but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game.  nadal outplays roddick to reach 40-0 but the american fights back to 40-30 before nadals powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game.  the crowd are getting very involved, cheering between roddicks first and second serves. but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set.  nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve. the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord.  roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure. a well-placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds.  a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game - the first time he has held serve so far in the match. if roddick didnt know before, he knows now that he is in a real contest.  another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof. he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows. four of the first five games have seen a break of serve.  despite the disappointment of losing his serve, roddick is not phased and storms into a 40-15 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line-call. nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net.  roddicks advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately. a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve, nadal pumps his fist in celebration.  the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadals serve from the start. nadals drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break.  after moyas win in the opening rubber, a raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadals impressive start which sees him race into a 30-0 lead. however roddick fights back to hold his serve."

463,atheletics040.txt,"radcliffe tackles marathon tasks  paula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday.  back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race.   the ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athletes belief that they can do it. every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, ""are you strong enough to finish?""  the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. ""there is an old adage, get straight back on the horse that threw you,"" richards told bbc sport. ""paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens. ""she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. ""if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. ""she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.""   for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york - win or lose. if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. but if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.  ""athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,"" explains richards, who has worked with past olympians. ""she must not get caught up in someone elses agenda."" radcliffes best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york. ""she just thought, well, they cant think any worse of me now,"" yelling told bbc sport. ""shes just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.""   radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as ""impulsive"" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. ""you cant change history,"" warned richards. ""only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. ""paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.""   the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves.  radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the athens marathon. ""its suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,"" said yelling, herself a marathon runner. ""but that is only for long-term health and fitness. ""when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. so physically it is possible for paula."" richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe. ""the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens,"" he said. ""and that just isnt going to be there in new york, thats been taken out of the equation.""     radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time. and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in new york. ""how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,"" argues richards.  ""one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities."" and yelling says: ""i think this will probably make paula."" ""i think it will drive her on and shell come out of it a better athlete."""

480,football202.txt,"gerrard future not decided by cardiff loss  steven gerrards own goal in liverpools carling cup defeat against chelsea sparked yet another round of speculation about his anfield future.  there was no denying the irony of gerrards mishap, coming as it did in a cup final against the club that almost paid £30m for him last summer. and that irony was not missed by the media - or indeed chelseas supporters. but to suggest the incident, and the defeat, will shape whether he stays or goes from liverpool, is wrong. it was just one of those things that could have happened anywhere at any time, in any place and in any game. it wasnt even a mistake, although you could say the mistake was in three liverpool defenders going for the same ball. but to pull together a sub-plot or conspiracy theory that the own goal, combined with liverpools defeat, has finally put gerrard on the road to stamford bridge is nonsense. it was inevitable that because it came against chelsea, there would be speculation, but i believe gerrard will be concentrating on one thing and one thing alone. and that is ensuring liverpool qualify for the champions league by getting that fourth place in the premiership. i dont think any decision has been made, and will certainly not be influenced by anything that happened in cardiff on sunday. liverpool must hope they clinch fourth place and that is enough to persuade their massively influential captain to stay.  from liverpools point of view, the defeat was a bitter disappointment, but when the disappointment has subsided, they can take heart from a week of encouragement both at home and abroad. liverpool had an excellent win against bayer leverkusen in the champions league, when they got it down, played and scored goals. and in sundays carling cup final, they showed real defensive resilience when they were pinned back for long periods. i think rafael benitez is on the right lines and speaks with a lot of confidence about his team and what he wants from them. but there is no doubt liverpools next two games will shape their season, at newcastle away in the league and then bayer away in the champions league second leg. what they cannot afford to do is produce any performances like they produced at burnley, southampton or birmingham. if they slip up at newcastle then everton beat blackburn 24 hours later, that will be an 11-point gap and thats an awful long way back for them in the race for the champions league place. there is added spice because everton are fourth. they had an impressive win at aston villa, and you cannot take away from them what they have done.  theyve had an uncertain spell recently, but theyve picked up points here and there and that is a great tribute to manager david moyes and his players. and in tim cahill, theyve paid £2m for a player from outside the premiership who has proved himself in the top-flight. liverpool will still be a massive magnet for top players, but they may also need to seek out the type of signings that moyes has pulled off with cahill. he has been excellent since arriving from millwall and has been a very sound purchase by moyes. while the battle for fourth hots up, manchester united turned the screw a little tighter on leaders chelsea by beating portsmouth and reducing the gap to six points - albeit with a game in hand for jose mourinhos side. the carling cup win against liverpool was massive for chelsea, because it stopped all the inevitable questions that would have been posed if they had lost three games in a week. i dont think they answered all the questions, because for all their long periods of possession they were struggling to score until gerrards unfortunate intervention. obviously a lot of focus has been centred on mourinho for events on and off the pitch, but i think he will be more than happy with that because it means the heat is taken off his players. if people are asking questions about the manager, they are leaving the players in peace, so mourinho will settle for that. and while united are showing once again there is no-one better when it comes to the chase, i dont think there is any shift in the balance of power in the premiership. it is all chelseas to lose, with a six-point lead and a game in hand. throw in that their next four league games are against the bottom four sides in the table, and you can see they are in a strong position. they must keep their eye on the ball because manchester united are masters of this situation - but the balance of power still lies with chelsea."

484,football014.txt,"clyde 0-5 celtic  celtic brushed aside clyde to secure their place in the scottish cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half.  the home sides craig bryson had a goal chopped off before stan varga headed celtic into the lead. alan thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after shaun maloney had been fouled. stilian petrov slid in a third, varga tapped in his second and craig bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. bryn halliwell was the busier keeper early on, saving from bellamy, chris sutton and juninho. clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from bryson, but the referee had already blown for a foul by petrov. from the resulting free kick, darren sheridan curled the ball round the celtic wall only for the post to deny him. back at the other end, halliwell did well to come off his line and block bellamys effort to lift the ball over him. the keeper misjudged a corner that stephane henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. the ball was delivered from the left and halliwell was left floundering as varga glanced the ball into the net.  maloney replaced the injured sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. the young striker fired a free kick straight into the clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by bryson and thompson converted the penalty. sheridan and bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. juninho brought out another good save from halliwell and then petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. but petrov and juninho combined brilliantly to allow the bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past halliwell from 12 yards. varga got his second goal of the game as celtic drove home their advantage - thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving aiden mcgeady, jackie mcnamara and maloney culminated in the welshman hammering the ball into the net. halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a mcgeady shot wide as the game petered out.  halliwell, mensing, bollan, balmer, potter, sheridan (burns 61), arbuckle (gilhaney 61), gibson, bryson (jones 78), malone, harty.  morrison, wilson.  mensing, sheridan.  douglas, henchoz, mcnamara, balde, varga, juninho paulista, thompson, lennon (lambert 70), sutton (maloney 45), petrov (mcgeady 70), bellamy.  marshall, laursen.  thompson, bellamy.  : varga 40, thompson 48 pen, petrov 60, varga 68, bellamy 72.  8,200  c thomson"

487,rugby131.txt,"ireland win eclipses refereeing errors  the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.  it may have to go the whole way and have nfl-style video cameras all over the field, or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. sundays explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948. the game was as exciting as it comes, with a much-improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. one can understand that frustration. there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sports ""blazers"". referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. after all, he has no public recourse to criticism.  it was the same for simon mcdowell, the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france. as far as england were concerned, there were queries over mark cuetos first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick.  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup. on that occasion, david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe, who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end.  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. however, one has to credit ireland flanker johnny oconnor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. but in rugby, everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. the referee also missed englands danny grewcock taking out ronan ogara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line. those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.  but there were many more, and one should not take away from those. brian odriscolls winning try was as well-conceived as they come, while charlie hodgsons brilliant kicking display was another highlight. and ronan ogaras tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on. the first was denis hickies brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross-field kick, then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try. irelands second-row colossus paul oconnell was equally superb. england had turned ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. unfortunately he ran into oconnell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. that spoke volumes about irelands back-foot display, with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end. to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward. it may be tries that win games, but it is defence that wins championships."

495,football212.txt,"a need to limit foreign numbers  with all the top clubs vying for the title and the champions league, at least the fa cup gave an opportunity for one or two of the younger lads at the major clubs to get a game in the first team.  i dont personally like to see weakened sides in the competition, but it seems in some cases its the only chance for the young lads to get some first-team experience. over the years the influx of foreign players has affected the young englishman more than anyone. i know you have to have freedom of movement but i do believe a time will come when countries will have to put a limit on the number of overseas players - including europeans.  i think the trend has become more noticeable since the influx of foreign bosses like arsene wenger, claudio ranieri and now jose mourinho. they seem to know the foreign market more than the english, although chelsea appear to be signing one or two young englishmen. when the foreigners first started coming into the country, i thought people like dennis bergkamp and gianfranco zola were absolutely magnificent. zola is still the best player i have ever seen in my time as a manager. i dont think anybody would ever begrudge players like that because you would pay money to watch these individuals. but i think the problem now is that clubs, even at the lower level, find english players expensive. agents are offering players left, right and centre who are not only cheap but can also come over on trial, which was unheard of in the past. bolton are a good example. i never thought they could be successful, but sam allardyce has waved his magic wand and brought these players over. the technology that sam uses has definitely paid off. he has all these databases on every foreign player.  he is a unique person - i never thought you could have 10 different nations in a dressing room and still have a good team spirit! but sam has proved that wrong over the last few years and will continue to do it. what bolton have said is they cant pay large transfer fees but they can get these players in for 6-12 months and compete at a high level that way. my view about foreign players changed about three years ago when i had quite a large number of them at bramall lane.  the match we played with west brom which was abandoned after we went down to six players changed my views on having a large amount of foreign players. i decided then to go with the kids and if i could sign english lads i would. i got two sent off in that game and one or two other things happened with players. i also found that with a couple of players that didnt talk english it is very difficult coaching-wise to get them to grasp the fundamentals. if possible i will look for players i sign to speak english, although we are in the process of signing hao haidong from china.  he has very limited english but is a very experienced player who i dont think you have to tell too many times what you want him to do. there was a time when scottish football was a good source for players but if you speak to people that look at players up there now it is clear the standard has dropped over the years. you only have to look at the scotland squad - the talent is not there any longer because they dont invest in their youth development. it is common knowledge we enquired about liverpools neil mellor, who could now find himself pushed down the pecking order by the arrival of fernando morientes from real madrid. i think people like neil are better off getting some games under their belt, but its difficult because liverpool are such a great club and he has had opportunities there. he has scored goals there so they rate him highly and it must be difficult for young players to turn their back on that and drop down to the championship level."

510,rugby092.txt,"dallaglio his own man to the end  controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career.  even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue, just four days before the start of the season. but then dallaglio has always been his own man. ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions. to supporters of england, dallaglio could do no wrong. an integral part of a sustained period of success for england, dallaglios crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003.  rival fans, meanwhile, have tended to take an alternative view, seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby. never afraid to speak his mind, be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch, or his coach or the media off it, dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993. it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv, but once there he proved to the manor born. displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years, dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard.  within two years of his debut, dallaglio was offered the england captains band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa. although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team-mate martin johnson, he played a massive role in the 2-1 series victory. but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.  first came the last-minute defeat to wales in which dallaglios decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam. worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy. with sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages, a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper. but he bounced back, getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold, albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson. as a member of a new-look england side on the long road to world cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned - dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.  yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglios involvement on the lions tour to australia.  rumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace, but ever the pragmatist, he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre.  the only player to play every minute of englands world cup triumph in australia, dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure englands historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters. following johnsons retirement, dallaglios career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain. while england did not hit the heights in dallaglios second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post-world cup tests, dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations. dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of englands most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.  the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. the likes of matt dawson, jonny wilkinson, phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglios role as captain. but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old. although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglios massive influence on english rugby."
511,tennis075.txt,"federer joins all-time greats  the last year has seen one player dominate mens tennis, and one country dominate the womens game.  roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in 1988 to win three grand slams in one season. and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open, two more followed at wimbledon and the us open. meanwhile, briton tim henman enjoyed his best year, while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles, and set about conquering new ground. the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open.  he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final. andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon, and federers performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking. federer again got the better of hewitt in the season-ending masters cup. his victory in houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final, an open era record. the only major let-down was a third-round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open, and roland garros will be his main target in 2005.  there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games, which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold. another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup, which was won by spain in a 3-2 home success over the usa in seville. roddick struggled on the clay, losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all-important fourth rubber.  henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open - a stunning effort - and also at the us open. a quarter-final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the britons defeat, but he remains optimistic of going further next year.  british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year, returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march. with his ranking down at 168, many feared the 31-year-olds career was over, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. the russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004, with myskina, maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams, before taking the season-ending fed cup. but while the young russians were on the way up, it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters. only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo, whose grand slam drought goes on. the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin-hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open.  a virus ruined the rest of henin-hardennes year, although she was fit enough to win olympic gold, but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt, and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence, myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all-russian final at the french open. wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw19, showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title.  davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but, hampered by injury, lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis. kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing, with the latters wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. with the russians still improving, the likes of henin-hardenne, clijsters, davenport, mauresmo, venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the mens side."

534,football213.txt,"no lack of christmas spirit  its that time of year when footballers and managers brace themselves for what i think is the most important period of the entire season.  i was thinking to myself last week that the last time i had a christmas off was 39 years ago. i have never been out of work at christmas as a player or manager since i was 17 when our youth team coach at chesterfield, a chap called reg wright, gave us christmans off. but only because there were no games. i think things have changed dramatically over the years in terms of discipline and looking after themselves. players take a lot more responsibility these days, in particular the older ones - im talking about those 32 and over, here. theyve changed their whole outlook in order to continue playing at this level. managers as well need to trust players more than we have in the past. in my squad i havent got anyone i have to warn regarding excess and over-eating, which is a massive bonus.  over the years, there have been some players in the squad who you would never know if they were going to turn up for training smelling of booze. as per usual, we will be training on christmas day, prior to our boxing day trip to coventry. but there are times when you can do too much over christmas, having the players in for training and then leaving for the game. ill try and strike a balance and after weve trained in the morning, the players can go home for a few hours and well leave for coventry about 7pm. i allow the players to have a pre-christmas night out. they came to me in november and asked if they could have a night out in leeds and i said no. i also said no to manchester, sheffield and nottingham and eventually let them go to dublin after we played at millwall. i send a minder with them to look after them, not because i dont trust them.  the problem is that nowadays, footballers are big news and you never know when somebody is going to step out with a mobile phone and take pictures of them. you have to trust your players to behave themselves, but unfortunately you cant govern for other peoples behaviour. there is always an idiot out there who wants to get himself a bit notoriety or his name in the local paper by picking a fight and taking a pop at a professional footballer. i also know that last year one newspaper asked certain young ladies to find out when and where players were holding their christmas parties in the hope of getting embarrassing photos. i tried to behave myself as a player and i remember when i was at scunthorpe, going to bed at 10pm on new years eve as we had a game on new years day.  i missed all the festivities and seeing the new year in, only to wake up the next morning to find there was two feet of snow on the ground! we all love christmas, though and i like to take my children william and amy to see the lights and take them to santas grotto. but when youre in football you accept that christmas is not the same for you as for others. in fact, until somebody mentioned it to me the other day, i never realised that its become the norm for me and others in football not to have a christmas holiday. one of the nice things when i do retire will be not having to worry about the phone ringing over christmas. youre always on tenterhooks on christmas day that somebody is injured or has had an accident playing with their kids. but i would like to take this opportunity to wish everybody a happy christmas and a prosperous new year."

537,football207.txt,"gunners clock up winning record  arsenal claimed the premiership title and re-wrote the record books in the process by going the entire 38-game season unbeaten.  it was the first time a team had gone through a top-flight season undefeated since preston in the 1888-89 season. arsenal romped home by a convincing 11-point margin from chelsea. the closest they came to defeat was in the so-called ""battle of old trafford"" when ruud van nistelrooy missed a last-minute penalty in a goalless draw.  it was a game that cast a shadow over the season, with van nistelrooy surrounded by angry arsenal players. arsenals lauren was banned for four games, martin keown three matches and ray parlour one after the incident. manchester united pair ryan giggs and cristiano ronaldo were also fined for their part in the fracas. arsenals title triumph made up for more disappointment on the european stage, where they lost to chelsea in the champions league quarter-finals. arsene wengers side looked on course to finally end their champions league drought, particularly after winning 5-1 away to inter milan.  but in a twist on their domestic domination, chelsea won 2-1 at highbury to clinch a 3-2 aggregate victory. manchester united fared even worse, going out to porto when francisco costina scored a last-minute old trafford equaliser. united finished third in the league, but had an fa cup win for consolation. portos success introduced manager jose mourinho to a wider audience, and particularly chelsea. chelsea manager claudio ranieri lived under a cloud of speculation all season, particulary claims he would be replaced by sven-goran eriksson. it intensified when eriksson was caught holding talks with chelsea chief executive peter kenyon. an embarrassed england coach was then awarded a new four-year contract by the football association. ranieri sealed his fate with a series of bizarre substitutions as chelsea lost 3-1 in the first leg of the champions league semi-final in monaco.  and when he inevitably lost his job, it was mourinho, who went on to win the champions league with porto, who stepped in to take over. mourinhos reign began well, with chelsea topping the premiership at christmas and joining arsenal, manchester united and liverpool in the next phase of the champions league. another manager to lose his job was liverpools gerard houllier, whose reign ended after six years. houllier paid the price for finishing fourth and without a trophy last term. he was replaced by valencias rafael benitez, whose impressive credentials included winning spains la liga and the uefa cup last season. valencia beat marseille 2-0 to cement benitezs growing reputation. manchester united enjoyed their moment of glory by beating millwall 3-0 in the fa cup final in cardiff. ruud van nistelrooy struck twice and cristiano ronaldo was also on target at dennis wises side were outclassed by their premiership opponents. wolves lost their premiership status, along with leicester city and leeds united, who completed a stunning decline from grace. leeds had reached the champions league semi-final three years before they went down after defeat at bolton. the three were replaced by norwich, west brom and crystal palace, who beat west ham in the play-off in cardiff. the summer saw big-spending in the transfer market, with wayne rooney the central figure in the drama. teenager rooney returned to everton after euro 2004 with superstar status assured after stunning performances. and when he refused to sign a new five-year contract, newcastle united opened the bidding at £20m. a transfer request followed and manchester united completed a £27m deal just hours before the transfer window closed at the end of august. rooney confirmed his worth with a hat-trick on his debut in the champions league against fenerbahce.  chelsea, inevitably, were among the big-spenders again, splashing out £24m on marseilles didier drogba and £20m on porto defender ricardo carvalho. last and by no means least, the other major piece of domestic silverware went to middlesbrough, who ended 128 barren years by winning the carling cup. they beat bolton 2-1 in the final with goals from joseph-desire job and a penalty from boudewijn zenden. the pressures of the top-flight were cruelly illustrated at southampton. paul sturrock was sacked only two games into the new season, one of which was a win against blackburn, and only 13 games in total at st marys. another manager to pay the price early-season was west broms gary megson, who was sacked after revealing he would not renew his contract. he guided west brom back into the premiership, but his relationship with chairman jeremy peace was fragile. bryan robson succeeded him as he returned to his old club. in scotland, henrik larsson bid an emotional and successful farewell to celtic after seven glorious seasons. celtic won the league and also the scottish cup, beating dunfermline 3-1 in the final, with the swede scoring twice to take his seasons tally to 41. and it took his overall celtic goals record to 242 goals in 315 appearances before joining barcelona. underdogs livingston claimed

546,rugby132.txt,"ireland 19-13 england  ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with a stirring victory at lansdowne road.  a second-half try from captain brian odriscoll and 14 points from ronan ogara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since 1948. england scored first through martin corry but had ""tries"" from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed. andy robinsons men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 world cup final. the defeat also heralded englands worst run in the championship since 1987. ireland last won the title, then the five nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales. and eddie osullivans side banished the ghosts of 2003 when england were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road. in front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in dublin, ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when ogara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.  england took their time to settle but their first real venture into irelands half produced a simple score for corry. the number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line, racing 25 yards to touch down. england fly-half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately ogara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession. england were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and hodgson, the villain at twickenham, coolly bisected the posts. the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking, but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. a series of probes led by the talismanic odriscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch.  from the line-out, the ball was recycled back to ogara, who stroked his second drop-goal, this time off the right upright. as the interval approached, wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for englands most promising attack. the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgsons cross-kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score, but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half. but another english indiscretion on a rare irish break-out awarded ogara a kick at goal, which he missed. englands pressure continued, and a wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed a drop-goal.  the lead was shortlived, however. ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson, ending with odriscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. ogara missed a penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when hodgsons cross-kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line. anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high, but ogara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. inside the last 10 minutes, england poured forward, spurred on by scrum-half matt dawson, who replaced leicesters harry ellis. but despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan - england were unable to pull off a face-saving win. ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks time before the potential title decider against wales in cardiff. england are still to meet italy at twickenham, in what is now a wooden spoon decider, and scotland.  g murphy; g dempsey, b odriscoll, s horgan, d hickie; r ogara, p stringer; r corrigan, s byrne, j hayes; m okelly, p oconnell; s easterby, j oconnor, a foley.  f sheahan, m horan, d ocallaghan, e miller, g easterby, d humphreys, k maggs.  j robinson (capt); m cueto, j noon, o barkley, j lewsey; c hodgson, h ellis; g rowntree, s thompson, m stevens; d grewcock, b kay; j worsley, l moody, m corry.  a titterrell, d bell, s borthwick, a hazell, m dawson, a goode, o smith."

""what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays. ""but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee cant make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on. ""thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. so you wouldnt be wasting a lot of time.  ""i think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. i think that would be an opening into a new area of football."" arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology.

""unfortunately, south africa have got an incredibly condensed programme from last november to the end of may."" south africa toured india prior to englands arrival and will follow their departure with series against zimbabwe and west indies. ""we need to play seven test matches and 10 one-day internationals during the course of the home programme to generate the revenue that helps fund all of english cricket. ""we are expected to reciprocate a similar amount of cricket over the winter months.  ""most years we manage that workload in a more acceptable way in terms of when the cricket is played.

""we werent in a position to demand a reduction in the number of test matches or one-day internationals,"" explained carr. he acknowledged the schedule was ""far from ideal"" for the players and said the subject of their workload was ""troubling"" the various boards around the world. ""we have to hold our hands up, along with the south african board, and say that this winter it hasnt been a satisfactory situation,"" carr added.  former england opening batsman geoffrey boycott described playing three tests back to back as ""madness"" and said carr and england coach duncan fletcher should never have agreed to it. but graham thorpe, at 35 the oldest member of the england test squad, told the bbc there was no point in complaining about the schedule.

""there are four, five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%.""  while that bodes well for rugby as a whole, it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade. while the wallabies, all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year, europes finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. and for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title.  that owes much to irelands continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.  , who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season, could go one better and win their first five/six nations title since 1985. they start with away games against italy and scotland, before england and france come to lansdowne road.  their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster irelands self-belief, while ronan ogaras late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie osullivans side can now close out tight games. not that england or france, who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them, will lay down quietly.  dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio, they still have the personnel to prosper.  the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden, but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson. a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident, and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff, a fourth title in six years is within reach.  are in familiar revival territory, but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style.  while south africas over-confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected, wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory. if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack, there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february. the last fortnight has left  in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia. a stunning defeat to argentina, their first loss since the world cup, could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency.  but the manner of new zealands 45-6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. fortunately for the french, the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining  in paris. after two reasonable performances against australia, the scots humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations, a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts.  , who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland, are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship. as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime, the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february."

592,football238.txt,"tapping-up row is so much hot air  the big talking point of the week is the issue of making illegal approaches or tapping up a player.  as usual, the issue is probably blown out of proportion, but i dont think anyone in football will deny there is a problem with the rules as they apply to recruiting players. i read somewhere at the weekend that they did a straw poll and questioned every player at a particular club as to how he got there. just about every one said the first approach was through their agent, or a third party or somebody involved with the club.  on that basis, under the rules as they stand, they all got there illegally. thats the name of the game these days, im afraid. not that i have ever tapped a player up - i wouldnt dream of it! i know there is a school of thought that says the rules that apply in football just wouldnt be tolerated in the outside business world. in business, if you want to change jobs, you can simply go and have a chat with another prospective employer. but in football youre not allowed to do that. football does have strange anomalies. for example, the game has a disciplinary procedure where there is no evidence but you can still find yourself in trouble. its the sort of thing that wouldnt happen in a court of law.  compared to the outside world, football does have some very restrictive practices, and a lot of them have to be looked at, but if you want to be part of it, you have to adhere to the rules. you try and do things the right way, but its like buying a house. if you do things properly and play by the rules youll find yourself gazumped. but i dont think the tapping situation is as bad as people say, a lot of it is hot air. by its very nature, the only people who would be approached are the top players who are in demand anyway. i dont think you would find too many approaches being made to bad players. the championship is building up to an exciting climax, and in beating us 2-0 last week, ipswich gave signs of what a good team they are. i think a place in the top two is beyond our reach, but any one of 11 teams could make the play-offs and there are still 15 games to go.  of course the play-offs are exciting for fans, but theyre not great for the heart-rates of managers. i think ive been involved in five play-off finals now and they should really come with a government health warning. ideally, you wouldnt want to be involved in the play-offs, and the way to do that is to finish in the top two, but i think that is beyond us now. weve got a decent run-in, were still trying to strengthen the squad and by the time the next league game comes round i would hope weve got somebody in.  but that brings me on to another matter, and the fact that the next game is more than a week away because of international matches. youre always concerned about your players getting injured and some clubs withdraw their players more than others. i always try and let our players go out for international games - it keeps them happy. but the other thorny issue with internationals is that of wages. i think that while players are on international duty, their wages should be paid by their countries. sometimes, they can be away for a week or more, but the clubs still have to find their wages, even though the player is denied to them for that period of time. of course, if a player is injured while on international duty, its the clubs who have to pay his wages while hes out of action and recovering. i think the associations of the country involved should bear some share of the responsibility."

620,atheletics034.txt,"athens memories soar above lows  well, its goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens.  obviously, theres no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe. but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics.      one of my favourite olympic moments was kellys success in the 800m.  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of ""should i, shouldnt i?"" thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldnt you do the 800m, its your best event? it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.      the victory for the british mens 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener, darren campbell, marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.      hicham el guerroujs olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kellys on a global scale.  he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and i had finished commentating, i jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with, even though my french and his english are not very good.      what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.  things like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesnt feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paulas olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me.      purely as a race, paulas victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenyas susan chepkemei and you dont usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, paula showed real ""bouncebackability"". and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.      kelly and the 4x100m boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that were not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.  the only individual mens finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed? and thats where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the beijing olympics and beyond.      i tell you what i really enjoyed this year, benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.      to be honest, im getting bored with all the drug scandals, especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.  having said that, im always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it."

""michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and were monitoring him,"" he told bbc newcastle. ""he is a great centre-forward and only 25 but i dont think were the only ones monitoring the situation at real."" souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburns club scoring record may influence the strikers decision.  milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957, while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name.

638,football076.txt,"aragones angered by racism fine  spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry.  the 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (£2,060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty. ""i am not guilty, nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport,"" he said. ""im not a racist and ive never lacked sporting decorum. ive never done that and i have medals for sporting merit."" aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal team-mate and spanish international jose reyes last october.  the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones, but was then requested to do so by spains anti-violence commission. the fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. arsenal boss arsene wenger, who was fined £15,000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating, believes that aragones punishment was too lenient. ""you compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should,"" wenger said. ""he shouldnt have said what he said, and how much money is enough, i dont know but it doesnt look a big punishment."" however, aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. ""i have been treated like islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete),"" said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. ""i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction. they have looked for a scapegoat."" spains anti-violence commission must now ratify the spanish fas decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. aragones has 10 days to appeal, and the commission can also appeal. alberto flores, president of the spanish fas disciplinary committee, said no-one in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had ""acted in a racist way."" ""a fine, the highest we could apply, is sufficient punishment. suspension would have been a bit exaggerated,"" flores told sports daily marca."
639,rugby143.txt,"italy 8-38 wales  wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome.  tries from jonathan thomas, tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain, shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this years tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and michael owens long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in.  stephen jones, who retained the kicking duties despite gavin hensons heroics against england, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.  henson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum, the home sides forward power brought them back into it. but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.  wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try. jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy. henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.  henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, jones adding the conversion. italy, who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. de marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain. before italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over.  with jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner. the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe. but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco, w pozzebon, a masi, l nitoglia; l orquera, a troncon; a lo cicero, f ongaro, m castrogiovanni, s dellape, m bortolami (capt), a persico, mauro bergamasco, s parisse.  g intoppa, s perugini, ca del fava, d dal maso, p griffen, m barbini, kp robertson.  g thomas (capt); h luscombe, t shanklin, g henson, s williams; s jones, d peel; g jenkins, m davies, a jones; b cockbain, r sidoli; j thomas, m williams, m owen.  r mcbryde, j yapp, i gough, r sowden-taylor, g cooper, c sweeney, k morgan.  andrew cole (australia)."

645,football116.txt,"tevez - an argentine in brazil  some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil.  he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. he left an impression, but not for reasons he would have wanted. the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. even today, gandula is the term used in brazil for ballboy. brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then, and many will delight now if history is repeated. another boca juniors player is coming to brazil. the new maradona - carlos tevez - is joining corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. corinthians - or the london-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez. it is particularly strange as - until last week - tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil, where the argentine championship is not shown.  presumably there is some financial logic behind the move. what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north, rather than across the atlantic. argentinas brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal. but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez. boca re-signed martin palermo, forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role. and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be disorganized. hounded by the press, tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires. so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of tranquillity. anyone acquainted with the city of s&#227;o paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration. brazils biggest city is a sprawling, ugly, restless metropolis. once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants.  but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians. it is the most passionately supported club in brazil. pel&#233; scored reams of goals against them, reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own. that passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays, when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazils big cities. corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players. tevez, then, can kiss tranquillity goodbye. he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores, south americas champions league. corinthians have not qualified. indeed, he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match. next years brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april. until then he will have to make do with the foolish s&#227;o paulo state championship, an appalling waste of his talent. there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina. like so many of the top south american players, tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left, to pass when he was expected to dribble, to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all."

""i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge. ""i am a fervent supporter of the break. it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season, which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league. ""the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage. ""the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today, the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed, rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february."" hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages, explaining: ""as i said, it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.  ""and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction. ""in pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players, having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot, find themselves getting very jaded. ""the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and, perhaps more importantly, recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead. ""the mental side is by far the most important thing."" hodgson added: ""the length of breaks can vary. in italy the break was very short. you just took christmas and new year. ""it was so short you didnt do anything. you gave the players a week or 10 days off, then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game. ""if it is longer, it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them."" and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership. he said: ""if we talk about football at elite level, which the premiership is, then i would support a winter break. ""if you examine the demands of the premier league and, in particular on players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally."""

718,atheletics030.txt,"2004: an irish athletics year  2004 wont be remembered as one of irish athletics great years.  the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably, seems to herald an upcoming olympiad. but come late august, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it. sonia osullivans olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers. but after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldnt have been surprised. at the start of the year, an osullivan had been earmarked as irelands best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. less than a week before the olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo. lombards shattering of mark carrolls national 10,000m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation. the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.  back at pre-olympic ranch in greece, it must have seemed that things couldnt have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens. once the track and field action began in athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair craggs performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. our beloved sonia scraped into the womens 5k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days, the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. as it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar. it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically, the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over, its unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. at least sonia managed to make it to athens. at the start of the year, several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august, an out-of-form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem, and a bad lane draw, meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.  james mcilroy, gareth turnbull, zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens. 800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. the injury-plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter. a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckees athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came. as the summer ended, stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. donnelly and his annadale striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on 18 december. a large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andys many friends. as only death can, it put the years athletics happenings in a sharp perspective."

""in coming to a decision on this case, chelsea believed the clubs social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company. ""any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as football association rules. ""the club totally supports the fa in strong action on all drugs cases."" fifas disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. and the sports world governing body has re-iterated their stance over mutus failed drugs test, maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities. ""fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the english fa have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it,"" said a fifa spokesman. chelseas move won backing from drug-testing expert michelle verroken. verroken, a former director of drug-free sport for uk sport, insists the blues were right to sack mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so. ""chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate. ""it was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make. ""it is a very clear stance by chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club."" it emerged that mutu had failed a drugs test on october 18 and, although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. the romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. the football association has yet to act on mutus failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case."
727,rugby024.txt,"wales critical of clumsy grewcock  wales coach mike ruddock says england lock danny grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked dwayne peel.  trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of wales 11-9 win in cardiff as grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot, leaving peel bloodied. grewcock was sin-binned with wales captain gareth thomas for retaliation. ""its up to the citing commissioner,"" said ruddock. ""im not saying its deliberate, but grewcock did a similar thing for bath against leinster."" last june grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against new zealand.  six years earlier, also in new zealand, grewcock became only the second england player to be sent off in tests. the player himself and his captain jason robinson have both said that the clash with peel was accidental. ""if the ball is at the back of the ruck and i feel i can step over and disrupt it then i will do that,"" said grewcock. but ruddock feels that the england man should be more careful. ""the boy himself should look at his actions, it was a clumsy piece of footwork,"" he said. ""hes a great player and i dont want to knock him, we wont be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident. ""im not going to go too far with the lad. it could just be a clumsy action and dwayne had just a minor cut. ""the referees interpretation was that grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck."" ruddock also warned his rbs 6 nations championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements. ""we created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually,"" said the coach. ""weve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely a lot of chances that we wasted."" in the forthcoming games, ruddock may use penalty hero gavin henson as his first-choice kicker in place of stephen jones. ""our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team, but its something well talk about in selection this week,"" said ruddock."

""the welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with,"" he told bbc sport. ""they have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years."" white is also impressed with the welsh packs strength in depth. ""gethin jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. he has played a bit at tight-head but i think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good,"" he added. the 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.  he destroyed south africas os du randt in the scrum at twickenham last autumn to give england the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. leicester, who signed white from bristol when the west country side were relegated from the zurich premiership in the summer of 2003, have also been aided by whites presence this season. the tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the heineken cup. ""i am pleased with my form,"" he said. ""but my form is helped by the people i play with at leicester - people like martin johnson and graham rowntree.

""i am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend."" white is now one of the more experienced members of the england squad which takes to the field on saturday. injuries have taken their toll and coach andy robinson has been deprived of richard hill, jonny wilkinson, martin corry, mike tindall, will greenwood and stuart abbott.  and with 27 caps and a world cup winners medal to his name, white is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres matthew tait and jamie noon. ""i dont know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way,"" he added. ""when i first came into the squad, people like jason leonard and martin johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.  ""it gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you. ""i was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good."" white missed the vast majority of last years six nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going. and that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in cardiff. ""i enjoy the atmosphere. the millennium stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world,"" he said. ""to go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - its one of my favourite places to play.
